00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:42.752 align:middle line:84%
All right, touchdown in two.

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.003 align:middle line:84%
Rules of engagement.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:45.839 align:middle line:84%
Electric rounds only.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.258 align:middle line:84%
MI6 wants them alive for questioning.

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:50.051 align:middle line:84%
The target's in a metal coffer.

00:00:50.051 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Every agency and terror cell
is looking for it.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.587 align:middle line:84%
Freeze!

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:27.964 align:middle line:90%
Down on the ground!
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:29.841 align:middle line:84%
Don't move!

00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:36.181 align:middle line:84%
All of you, get down!

00:01:36.181 --> 00:02:06.169 align:middle line:84%
Stay back! Get back!

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:10.632 align:middle line:84%
Asset secured.

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:12.842 align:middle line:84%
MI6.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.052 align:middle line:84%
Freeze!

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:16.429 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, whoa. I'm a fan.

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:17.597 align:middle line:84%
Fantastic job,

00:02:17.597 --> 00:02:20.683 align:middle line:90%
and I think you look amazing
in your matching outfits.

00:02:20.683 --> 00:02:22.477 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell are you?

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:23.978 align:middle line:84%
Bad guy.

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:33.238 align:middle line:84%
Get on the ground now!

00:02:33.238 --> 00:04:11.336 align:middle line:84%
Nah.

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:12.587 align:middle line:84%
Bulldog Two.

00:04:12.587 --> 00:04:14.005 align:middle line:84%
The team is down.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:15.757 align:middle line:84%
We've been betrayed.

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
She took the virus.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
One of the soldiers
got away with the virus.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:39.656 align:middle line:90%
I want her on the run
with no place to turn.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:42.116 align:middle line:84%
She is a wily one.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:43.243 align:middle line:84%
Monitor all channels

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:45.203 align:middle line:84%
and make sure she takes the fall for it.

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.829 align:middle line:90%
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.123 align:middle line:90%
What you want us to do
with these assholes?

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:52.293 align:middle line:84%
Clean it up. I don't care. No witnesses.

00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:55.046 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna get it back.

00:04:55.046 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Who's gonna stop me?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:06:42.946 align:middle line:90%
- Where?
- Where?

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:44.364 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell are you?

00:06:44.364 --> 00:06:59.254 align:middle line:90%
Ooh. I'm what you call
"an ice-cold can of whup-ass."

00:06:59.254 --> 00:07:01.047 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell are you?

00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:16.354 align:middle line:90%
I'm what you might call
"a champagne problem."

00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:42.172 align:middle line:84%
What you got, big man?

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:48.428 align:middle line:84%
Really thought that would have broke.

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:55.143 align:middle line:84%
Uh-uh.

00:07:55.143 --> 00:07:56.561 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna kill you!

00:07:56.561 --> 00:08:14.621 align:middle line:84%
You gonna die!

00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:16.539 align:middle line:84%
All right, all right. Oh, no, no.

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.166 align:middle line:84%
That's my favorite jacket. Don't do that.

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Hi, sweetheart.
Could you pass me that gun, please?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.922 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much. Nice tats.

00:08:23.922 --> 00:08:25.381 align:middle line:90%
All right, ass-clown.
We're gonna play a little game.

00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:26.799 align:middle line:84%
It's called hangman.

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:28.134 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

00:08:28.134 --> 00:08:31.429 align:middle line:84%
When you give me an answer I don't like...

00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:33.348 align:middle line:84%
Okay, you get the idea.

00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:34.724 align:middle line:84%
I've been tracking some dark web chatter

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:35.808 align:middle line:84%
about a super virus

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:37.769 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up on the auction block.

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.187 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you tell me about it?

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:41.064 align:middle line:84%
I swear, I don't know.

00:08:41.064 --> 00:08:45.026 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that answer.

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.237 align:middle line:90%
A little bird told me
about a shadow outfit.

00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:49.656 align:middle line:84%
Black tech. Blood ops.

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:52.158 align:middle line:84%
Real assholes. Like you.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:53.535 align:middle line:84%
They're called Eteon.

00:08:53.535 --> 00:08:55.328 align:middle line:90%
And you're gonna tell me
where to find them.

00:08:55.328 --> 00:08:56.412 align:middle line:84%
You're not gonna tell me

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:58.081 align:middle line:84%
because I'm hanging you out of a window.

00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.499 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna tell me

00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:08.675 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the guy willing to drop you.

00:09:08.675 --> 00:09:10.885 align:middle line:84%
All right, bonus round.

00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:12.178 align:middle line:84%
Where's the virus?

00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:13.972 align:middle line:84%
No! No, wait!

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:16.432 align:middle line:84%
Don't leave me out here! Please!

00:09:16.432 --> 00:09:23.147 align:middle line:84%
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

00:09:23.147 --> 00:09:41.791 align:middle line:84%
What did he write?

00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:45.128 align:middle line:84%
"A, A, A." Excellent.

00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:47.505 align:middle line:90%
Oh, by the way,
your Old Man and the Sea report

00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
from last week?

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.341 align:middle line:84%
You did so good, it was awesome.

00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:90%
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Give me some. Yes. Yeah.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.595 align:middle line:84%
What's that?

00:09:53.595 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Um, it's a social studies assignment.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.559 align:middle line:84%
It's a family tree.

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.853 align:middle line:84%
It's just a sketch.

00:10:01.853 --> 00:10:03.396 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.

00:10:03.396 --> 00:10:06.941 align:middle line:90%
That's our family tree right there.
It's, uh...

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:12.822 align:middle line:84%
It's super easy to read and very clear.

00:10:12.822 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.037 align:middle line:84%
But I was going to use this.

00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:22.248 align:middle line:84%
I found it in a garage drawer.

00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:25.335 align:middle line:84%
That's you, isn't it?

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:27.545 align:middle line:84%
Who's Jonah?

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:31.341 align:middle line:84%
Is that your brother?

00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:33.134 align:middle line:84%
Yup. That's my brother.

00:10:33.134 --> 00:10:36.346 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you ever talk about Samoa?

00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:38.181 align:middle line:84%
Did something happen?

00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:40.767 align:middle line:84%
In life, things happen.

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:45.939 align:middle line:84%
You may not want them to, but they do.

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:49.651 align:middle line:84%
You just gotta do your best...

00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:51.027 align:middle line:84%
and move on.

00:10:51.027 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And the fact of the matter is
I'm your family.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.908 align:middle line:84%
I'm your people. Me.

00:10:56.908 --> 00:11:00.161 align:middle line:90%
- And you're a whole lot.
- Oh, I am a whole lot.

00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:03.706 align:middle line:84%
Look at this. Perfect timing.

00:11:03.706 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, this is the mini.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.877 align:middle line:90%
- Yup.
- Thank you so much.

00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:11.172 align:middle line:90%
- Cheat day?
- Cheat day. Yeah.

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:15.969 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much.

00:11:15.969 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that really necessary?

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.264 align:middle line:84%
Come on! She's 71 years old.

00:11:19.264 --> 00:11:20.348 align:middle line:84%
What's the matter with you lot?

00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:23.434 align:middle line:90%
Sir, the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency

00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:25.812 align:middle line:90%
when she proves
to be less of a security risk.

00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:27.438 align:middle line:84%
If someone leaves a back door open,

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:29.065 align:middle line:84%
it's a bit daft not to try and use it.

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.651 align:middle line:90%
What's daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open

00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:33.403 align:middle line:90%
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut.

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:35.697 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, my point still stands.

00:11:35.697 --> 00:11:37.907 align:middle line:90%
If you can't break out
of a shitty prison like this,

00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
then you're seriously slipping, Mum.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.952 align:middle line:84%
You cheeky bugger.

00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:43.288 align:middle line:90%
Speaking of breaking out,
where's my birthday cake?

00:11:43.288 --> 00:11:45.874 align:middle line:90%
The one with the file in it?
They're baking it.

00:11:45.874 --> 00:11:47.125 align:middle line:84%
Who wants a bloody file?

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:48.793 align:middle line:84%
What I want is a nice little bit of C-4.

00:11:48.793 --> 00:11:50.962 align:middle line:84%
Listen, if you want out of here,

00:11:50.962 --> 00:11:53.381 align:middle line:84%
just say the word. I'll handle it.

00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Decks, I'm just having
a bit of fun really.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.302 align:middle line:84%
Being banged up doesn't bother me.

00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.012 align:middle line:84%
I quite enjoy the peace and quiet.

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:00.513 align:middle line:84%
You know, nice walk,

00:12:00.513 --> 00:12:02.682 align:middle line:84%
bit of reading, loads of sudoku.

00:12:02.682 --> 00:12:05.435 align:middle line:84%
It's like being retired. Love it.

00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:08.938 align:middle line:90%
Now listen, have you spoken
with your sister?

00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:10.356 align:middle line:84%
You know I haven't, Mum.

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:11.941 align:middle line:90%
- Give me your hand.
- There she goes.

00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:15.028 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you and your sister,
you used to be inseparable.

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:17.447 align:middle line:90%
What happened, Decks?
What happened between you?

00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:19.365 align:middle line:84%
I remember you, Owen, and Hattie

00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:21.409 align:middle line:84%
playing out in the backyard.

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:23.703 align:middle line:84%
Your little games, your little grifts.

00:12:23.703 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Robbing banks.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.457 align:middle line:90%
You used to give
your little scams code names.

00:12:27.457 --> 00:12:28.541 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember?

00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:32.045 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, what was that one? Um...
- The "Keith Moon."

00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:33.588 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:35.048 align:middle line:90%
It was called the "Keith Moon"
because it...

00:12:35.048 --> 00:12:37.217 align:middle line:90%
It involved
lots of explosive percussion

00:12:37.217 --> 00:12:48.269 align:middle line:84%
and permanent ear damage.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.354 align:middle line:84%
That's my boy.

00:12:49.354 --> 00:12:51.523 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we left the family business.

00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:52.899 align:middle line:84%
She loves you, you know?

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:55.777 align:middle line:90%
All you gotta do
is pick up the phone, Decks.

00:12:55.777 --> 00:12:59.322 align:middle line:84%
Look at me. You're her big brother.

00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:00.573 align:middle line:84%
She looks up to you.

00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:05.245 align:middle line:84%
Used to.

00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:09.958 align:middle line:90%
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.293 align:middle line:84%
and I see the two of you sitting there.

00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:14.045 align:middle line:84%
How many years you got left?

00:13:14.045 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Two, with good behavior.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.051 align:middle line:90%
- So how many, really?
- Four.

00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.512 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know what they say.

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:24.681 align:middle line:84%
"Never say 'never.'"

00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:26.474 align:middle line:84%
Time's up.

00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:28.017 align:middle line:84%
You behave yourself.

00:13:28.017 --> 00:13:29.853 align:middle line:84%
Will do. Love you, darling.

00:13:29.853 --> 00:13:45.368 align:middle line:84%
Love you too.

00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:48.872 align:middle line:90%
- All right.
- Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:51.332 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen you in forever.

00:13:51.332 --> 00:13:52.417 align:middle line:84%
"Rebecca"?

00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:54.919 align:middle line:84%
Do you even age? How long's it been?

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:56.171 align:middle line:90%
- Six months.
- Time flies.

00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:57.255 align:middle line:84%
When we're apart.

00:13:57.255 --> 00:13:59.007 align:middle line:84%
What is your skin care regimen?

00:13:59.007 --> 00:14:01.926 align:middle line:90%
Because you look
like a young Shirley Temple.

00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:03.052 align:middle line:84%
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.345 align:middle line:84%
Daddy, who is this guy?

00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:08.141 align:middle line:84%
Well, this guy is, uh, Locke.

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:10.268 align:middle line:84%
And he works for the CIA.

00:14:10.268 --> 00:14:11.394 align:middle line:84%
Your dad and I are old friends.

00:14:11.394 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:90%
- We're not old friends.
- Actually, we're, um...

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.648 align:middle line:84%
We're best friends. Here's the half heart.

00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:17.025 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what that is.

00:14:17.025 --> 00:14:18.109 align:middle line:84%
We got some ink together as well.

00:14:18.109 --> 00:14:19.194 align:middle line:84%
We did not get ink together.

00:14:19.194 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, we didn't?
- No, we did not.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.155 align:middle line:90%
- Huh. Interesting.
- We never got ink together.

00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:23.239 align:middle line:84%
Well, I seem to remember

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:24.824 align:middle line:84%
getting a little something like this

00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:26.868 align:middle line:84%
at one point on my body.

00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:27.952 align:middle line:90%
- Jesus.
- Christ,

00:14:27.952 --> 00:14:29.078 align:middle line:84%
I miss our playful banter.

00:14:29.078 --> 00:14:30.663 align:middle line:90%
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

00:14:30.663 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
before I knock one of your lungs loose.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.958 align:middle line:84%
You and I are after the same thing.

00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.336 align:middle line:84%
Say hello to the CT-17 virus.

00:14:36.336 --> 00:14:39.255 align:middle line:90%
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions.

00:14:39.255 --> 00:14:41.799 align:middle line:84%
Affectionately code-named "the Snowflake."

00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:43.051 align:middle line:84%
What does the Snowflake do?

00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:44.135 align:middle line:84%
Oh, nothing much.

00:14:44.135 --> 00:14:45.803 align:middle line:84%
Just, uh, liquefies your internal organs.

00:14:45.803 --> 00:14:48.765 align:middle line:90%
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:50.016 align:middle line:84%
She is nine.

00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:51.434 align:middle line:90%
- Seen worse.
- Where?

00:14:51.434 --> 00:14:52.852 align:middle line:84%
Game of Thrones. Janet's house.

00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:53.937 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of it.

00:14:53.937 --> 00:14:55.021 align:middle line:84%
A Lannister always pays his debts.

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:56.689 align:middle line:84%
You're never going over there again.

00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:58.775 align:middle line:90%
But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

00:14:58.775 --> 00:15:03.029 align:middle line:90%
The specifics...
are all in the brief.

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:04.489 align:middle line:84%
There you go.

00:15:04.489 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:90%
- She's ready, Becca.
- She's nine. She's nine!

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.744 align:middle line:90%
This is the only unit of CT-17
in existence,

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:12.247 align:middle line:84%
and this Snowflake is now in the hands of

00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.415 align:middle line:84%
a rogue MI6 operative in London.

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:17.669 align:middle line:84%
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

00:15:17.669 --> 00:15:19.838 align:middle line:84%
No. She is unusually attractive.

00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:21.047 align:middle line:84%
And deadly.

00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:22.841 align:middle line:84%
Last night she was part of an MI6 team

00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
tasked with securing the virus.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:90%
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.515 align:middle line:90%
She stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick.

00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how hard that is?

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.893 align:middle line:84%
To stab someone using a brick?

00:15:33.893 --> 00:15:35.061 align:middle line:90%
- Get to the point.
- The point is

00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:36.145 align:middle line:84%
there's no sharp edge.

00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:37.355 align:middle line:84%
How did she get an entire brick

00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:38.815 align:middle line:84%
into another person's chest?

00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
She either had to be really strong

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.776 align:middle line:90%
or the other person
had to have been, like,

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.987 align:middle line:84%
born without, like, bones.

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Get to the larger point.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.489 align:middle line:84%
She stole the Snowflake.

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.741 align:middle line:90%
- She went totally off-grid.
- Who's this?

00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Great. Where do I find him?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.454 align:middle line:84%
He's off-grid too.

00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:55.206 align:middle line:84%
Impossible to find. Maybe dead.

00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:56.374 align:middle line:84%
You're very helpful, Locke.

00:15:56.374 --> 00:15:58.168 align:middle line:84%
And you're the world's best tracker.

00:15:58.168 --> 00:15:59.586 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:01.004 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, no, no.

00:16:01.004 --> 00:16:03.339 align:middle line:84%
I'm DSS, you're CIA. I don't work for you.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:05.967 align:middle line:90%
Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dickface.

00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:07.218 align:middle line:90%
- What'd you just call me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:08.887 align:middle line:84%
Let's just settle down. All right?

00:16:08.887 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:90%
We've already got a black site
running in London.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.348 align:middle line:90%
There's an operative there.
Top of his game.

00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:13.433 align:middle line:84%
He'll be your contact.

00:16:13.433 --> 00:16:15.143 align:middle line:84%
I don't need anybody else. I work alone.

00:16:15.143 --> 00:16:17.353 align:middle line:90%
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego,

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:18.646 align:middle line:84%
or the fact that a moment ago

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:22.025 align:middle line:84%
I most definitely shit my pants.

00:16:22.025 --> 00:16:24.319 align:middle line:90%
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:25.528 align:middle line:84%
This thing gets out,

00:16:25.528 --> 00:16:27.113 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at a lot of
liquefied organs,

00:16:27.113 --> 00:16:29.115 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, like, everywhere.

00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.202 align:middle line:84%
And not just yours and mine.

00:16:32.202 --> 00:16:37.207 align:middle line:84%
Uh... He knows I can see him, right?

00:16:37.207 --> 00:16:41.377 align:middle line:84%
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:42.879 align:middle line:84%
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:46.174 align:middle line:84%
You gonna partner up?

00:16:46.174 --> 00:16:47.634 align:middle line:90%
- I'm in.
- Of course you are.

00:16:47.634 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda?

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.929 align:middle line:90%
- "It still burns"?
- No, the other thing.

00:16:50.929 --> 00:16:53.348 align:middle line:90%
- "Stop watching me sleep."
- I said,

00:16:53.348 --> 00:16:56.184 align:middle line:90%
- "We are not friends at all."
- We're best friends.

00:16:56.184 --> 00:16:58.228 align:middle line:90%
- And to watch your back.
- Can I wash your back, yeah.

00:16:58.228 --> 00:16:59.812 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, I remember.
- Watch your back.

00:16:59.812 --> 00:17:01.189 align:middle line:84%
Lot of back. I got you.

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:03.566 align:middle line:84%
Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh?

00:17:03.566 --> 00:17:06.694 align:middle line:84%
Same old Locke.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:16.454 align:middle line:84%
All right. Who's on the case?

00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:17.539 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Shaw.

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:18.706 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, I ain't buying it.

00:17:18.706 --> 00:17:20.792 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what I'm selling,
or who I am.

00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:21.876 align:middle line:84%
CIA.

00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:24.254 align:middle line:90%
- How could you...
- Sunglasses, cloudy day,

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:26.214 align:middle line:84%
sensible shoes.

00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:28.049 align:middle line:84%
I have fallen arches,

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:29.509 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I...

00:17:29.509 --> 00:17:30.593 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'm Agent Loeb,

00:17:30.593 --> 00:17:31.886 align:middle line:90%
and I need to talk to you
about our shared interest.

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.137 align:middle line:84%
Hey, how'd you find me?

00:17:33.137 --> 00:17:34.931 align:middle line:84%
I got a tip from an acquaintance of yours:

00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:36.015 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Nobody.

00:17:36.015 --> 00:17:37.934 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Nobody.

00:17:37.934 --> 00:17:39.853 align:middle line:84%
Little joke for you, Loeb.

00:17:39.853 --> 00:17:43.314 align:middle line:90%
What do, uh, CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
People cheer when you hit them with a bat.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
No.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.406 align:middle line:90%
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

00:17:51.406 --> 00:17:58.329 align:middle line:84%
That works too.

00:17:58.329 --> 00:17:59.622 align:middle line:84%
The weapon she's stolen

00:17:59.622 --> 00:18:01.165 align:middle line:84%
is not like anything we've ever seen.

00:18:01.165 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a programmable disease

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.586 align:middle line:84%
that can target any DNA sequence

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:07.755 align:middle line:90%
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:09.507 align:middle line:84%
If MI6 finds her,

00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:11.092 align:middle line:84%
they're gonna treat her like a traitor.

00:18:11.092 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
We need you
to surrender the virus.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.183 align:middle line:84%
What is your location?

00:18:18.183 --> 00:18:19.726 align:middle line:84%
What, you think I killed them?

00:18:19.726 --> 00:18:21.477 align:middle line:84%
But if you help us find her,

00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:23.021 align:middle line:84%
if you bring us the virus,

00:18:23.021 --> 00:18:28.359 align:middle line:84%
we'll grant her immunity.

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:30.361 align:middle line:84%
We've set up a black site here in London.

00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:32.488 align:middle line:90%
You've got everything you
could need at your disposal,

00:18:32.488 --> 00:18:35.158 align:middle line:90%
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

00:18:35.158 --> 00:18:36.868 align:middle line:84%
I don't need anybody.

00:18:36.868 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:44.417 align:middle line:84%
But she does.

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
- My guy's in.
- My guy's in too.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.046 align:middle line:84%
Hey, is your guy gonna freak out

00:18:48.046 --> 00:18:49.172 align:middle line:84%
when he finds out who my guy is?

00:18:49.172 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, didn't they just do
a job together in New York?

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.134 align:middle line:90%
Didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in LA

00:18:53.134 --> 00:18:54.886 align:middle line:84%
by throwing each other through it?

00:18:54.886 --> 00:18:56.638 align:middle line:90%
I don't know. Look,
I don't know about your guy,

00:18:56.638 --> 00:18:57.722 align:middle line:84%
but my guy?

00:18:57.722 --> 00:18:58.806 align:middle line:84%
He's gonna get this.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:00.141 align:middle line:84%
He's gonna pull this off. You know why?

00:19:00.141 --> 00:19:02.519 align:middle line:90%
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:04.354 align:middle line:84%
Well, my guy beat the shit out of me

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:06.481 align:middle line:84%
at a bar in KrakÃ³w 17 years ago,

00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:08.191 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't even remember me.

00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:10.693 align:middle line:84%
So we all have our histories.

00:19:10.693 --> 00:19:12.487 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's the fate of the world here.

00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:13.613 align:middle line:84%
It's the fate of the world.

00:19:13.613 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
The planet's population is in their hands.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.908 align:middle line:84%
Serious stuff.

00:19:16.908 --> 00:19:18.409 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you'd think
they'd be able to put aside

00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:20.078 align:middle line:84%
any petty rivalries to save the world.

00:19:20.078 --> 00:19:21.538 align:middle line:84%
Mmm. Mmm.

00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:23.414 align:middle line:90%
- No fucking way.
- No fucking way.

00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:25.917 align:middle line:90%
I'm not working with this guy.
I been there, done that.

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The minute he gets involved,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.753 align:middle line:84%
you can kiss goodbye to any finesse,

00:19:28.753 --> 00:19:31.214 align:middle line:90%
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:33.758 align:middle line:90%
And Mr. Arson here only knows
how to blow shit up.

00:19:33.758 --> 00:19:35.134 align:middle line:90%
- The fact is...
- And the fact is...

00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:36.845 align:middle line:90%
- ...no offense...
- ...oh, no offense...

00:19:36.845 --> 00:19:40.181 align:middle line:90%
- ...this guy's a real asshole.
- ...this guy's a real asshole.

00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:43.101 align:middle line:90%
That's, uh, "sumbitch"
in your native tongue.

00:19:43.101 --> 00:19:45.395 align:middle line:84%
That'd be "wanker" in your native tongue.

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:46.646 align:middle line:84%
Are you finished blubbering?

00:19:46.646 --> 00:19:48.398 align:middle line:84%
You sound like a giant tattooed baby.

00:19:48.398 --> 00:19:49.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm not listening to this horseshit.

00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:51.901 align:middle line:84%
I got a job to do.

00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:53.611 align:middle line:84%
Tell your mom I said hi.

00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.697 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

00:19:55.697 --> 00:19:57.198 align:middle line:84%
Don't you ever talk about my mother.

00:19:57.198 --> 00:19:58.658 align:middle line:84%
I'll put your head through that wall.

00:19:58.658 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I'll have this job done

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.453 align:middle line:90%
while you're still
putting on your baby oil.

00:20:02.453 --> 00:20:04.122 align:middle line:84%
Good luck, slick.

00:20:04.122 --> 00:20:06.708 align:middle line:84%
That's it. You just reminded me.

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:10.336 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly why
I hate working with you.

00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:12.547 align:middle line:84%
It's your voice.

00:20:12.547 --> 00:20:14.841 align:middle line:84%
It's your nasally, prepubescent,

00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:16.593 align:middle line:84%
Harry Potter voice.

00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Every time you speak,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.304 align:middle line:84%
just imagine this for a second,

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:24.726 align:middle line:90%
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

00:20:24.726 --> 00:20:27.478 align:middle line:90%
- And it hurts.
- Well, for me,

00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:29.564 align:middle line:84%
it's not your voice.

00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:30.648 align:middle line:84%
It's your face.

00:20:30.648 --> 00:20:33.193 align:middle line:84%
Your big, stupid face.

00:20:33.193 --> 00:20:34.903 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it makes me feel

00:20:34.903 --> 00:20:39.699 align:middle line:90%
like God is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

00:20:39.699 --> 00:20:42.744 align:middle line:84%
And it burns.

00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:45.914 align:middle line:84%
It really burns.

00:20:45.914 --> 00:20:48.583 align:middle line:90%
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:49.709 align:middle line:84%
For your information, I was gonna

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:51.294 align:middle line:84%
take this chair and turn it sideways

00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:53.546 align:middle line:84%
and shove it right down your throat.

00:20:53.546 --> 00:20:54.631 align:middle line:84%
Of course you are,

00:20:54.631 --> 00:20:55.965 align:middle line:84%
'cause that's your answer to everything.

00:20:55.965 --> 00:20:58.927 align:middle line:90%
Smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck.

00:20:58.927 --> 00:21:01.095 align:middle line:90%
- That's not gonna work here.
- Ah, I think it'll work fine.

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:03.264 align:middle line:90%
Guys,
why don't you two take a seat

00:21:03.264 --> 00:21:08.144 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk through this?

00:21:08.144 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Me and you? Us? I've been down this road.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.232 align:middle line:84%
It's a total waste of time.

00:21:12.232 --> 00:21:13.733 align:middle line:84%
For once, I couldn't agree with you more.

00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:16.027 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way.

00:21:16.027 --> 00:21:17.987 align:middle line:84%
If anyone's got a problem with that,

00:21:17.987 --> 00:21:19.739 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you come out here and stop me.

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:21.366 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going in there.

00:21:21.366 --> 00:21:23.201 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going in there.

00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:33.211 align:middle line:84%
Smart lads.

00:21:33.211 --> 00:21:34.546 align:middle line:84%
All right,

00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:36.422 align:middle line:90%
now that we got rid
of that fun sponge,

00:21:36.422 --> 00:21:37.757 align:middle line:84%
we can get to work.

00:21:37.757 --> 00:21:38.883 align:middle line:84%
I want you to pull up

00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:40.385 align:middle line:84%
every CCTV camera around central London.

00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:90%
We already have two dozen agents
scouring footage.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.806 align:middle line:84%
Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:46.057 align:middle line:84%
I just care about the coverage.

00:21:46.057 --> 00:21:51.312 align:middle line:84%
I ain't gonna ask you again. Pull it up.

00:21:51.312 --> 00:21:54.941 align:middle line:84%
Now zoom in on the area of the heist.

00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:56.693 align:middle line:84%
Now invert it.

00:21:56.693 --> 00:22:01.573 align:middle line:90%
Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

00:22:01.573 --> 00:22:03.783 align:middle line:84%
She's smart.

00:22:03.783 --> 00:22:05.368 align:middle line:84%
She just killed her entire team

00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:07.912 align:middle line:84%
and stole a deadly virus.

00:22:07.912 --> 00:23:40.713 align:middle line:84%
She ain't waiting around for no picture.

00:23:40.713 --> 00:23:44.717 align:middle line:84%
Got a lot of nasty people looking for you.

00:23:44.717 --> 00:23:46.386 align:middle line:84%
Are you nasty?

00:23:46.386 --> 00:23:47.929 align:middle line:84%
Well, it all depends on what happens

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:49.222 align:middle line:84%
in the next 30 seconds.

00:23:49.222 --> 00:23:59.816 align:middle line:84%
Promises, promises.

00:23:59.816 --> 00:24:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So here's how it's gonna go down.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.528 align:middle line:84%
We do this the hard way or the easy way.

00:24:03.528 --> 00:24:05.154 align:middle line:90%
- Are you serious?
- I am.

00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:06.239 align:middle line:90%
- Really?
- Yes.

00:24:06.239 --> 00:24:07.323 align:middle line:84%
Mmm.

00:24:07.323 --> 00:24:09.492 align:middle line:90%
- Well, it's a tough decision.
- No, it's really not.

00:24:09.492 --> 00:24:12.495 align:middle line:84%
You want me to freeze?

00:24:12.495 --> 00:24:14.539 align:middle line:84%
Let me see your hands.

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:17.834 align:middle line:84%
Fine.

00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:21.254 align:middle line:84%
But you're not gonna like what's in 'em.

00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:23.798 align:middle line:90%
- Think I made up my mind.
- You seem like a smart woman.

00:24:23.798 --> 00:24:24.883 align:middle line:84%
I am.

00:24:24.883 --> 00:24:27.802 align:middle line:84%
The hard way.

00:24:27.802 --> 00:24:40.481 align:middle line:84%
Look... Whoa! Hold on!

00:24:40.481 --> 00:24:46.863 align:middle line:84%
Stop!

00:24:46.863 --> 00:24:59.417 align:middle line:84%
Jeez.

00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:28.655 align:middle line:84%
Hey! No.

00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:57.433 align:middle line:90%
- Are you taking it easy on me?
- For the moment.

00:25:57.433 --> 00:25:59.185 align:middle line:90%
Bet you wish you didn't
take it easy on me now.

00:25:59.185 --> 00:26:10.446 align:middle line:84%
I wish a lot of things right now.

00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:12.115 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go to sleep now.

00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:14.367 align:middle line:84%
It's all gonna seem like a bad dream.

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:16.077 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a nightmare.

00:26:16.077 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing is a nightmare.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:46.983 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's me and you
have a little chat.

00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:48.902 align:middle line:84%
The director called.

00:26:48.902 --> 00:26:49.986 align:middle line:84%
He ordered a new baseline for you.

00:26:49.986 --> 00:26:54.199 align:middle line:90%
He has everything
ready for you in medical.

00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:55.658 align:middle line:84%
Perfection is

00:26:55.658 --> 00:26:58.244 align:middle line:84%
a painful process, Brixton,

00:26:58.244 --> 00:27:02.916 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves and in the
pursuit of a perfect world.

00:27:02.916 --> 00:27:08.087 align:middle line:90%
Humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself.

00:27:08.087 --> 00:27:09.547 align:middle line:84%
Eteon will carve out

00:27:09.547 --> 00:27:11.549 align:middle line:84%
all human weakness...

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:14.719 align:middle line:90%
...and replace it
with mechanical perfection.

00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:20.266 align:middle line:84%
And you will lead the way.

00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:22.101 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna ask you a question.

00:27:22.101 --> 00:27:24.145 align:middle line:84%
It's not what you think it is.

00:27:24.145 --> 00:27:25.313 align:middle line:84%
Do you like to dance?

00:27:25.313 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
What, the Electric Slide?

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.859 align:middle line:84%
The Macarena? No, I don't.

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:33.321 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, I was thinking
about... the tango.

00:27:33.321 --> 00:27:36.074 align:middle line:90%
- Where it takes two.
- Yeah, don't know that one.

00:27:36.074 --> 00:27:40.411 align:middle line:84%
Must be different generations.

00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:43.248 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, either way, the music started,

00:27:43.248 --> 00:27:46.334 align:middle line:84%
so let's see what kind of rhythm you have.

00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:47.669 align:middle line:90%
- Where's the virus?
- Look, I told you,

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:48.837 align:middle line:84%
I've no idea what you're talking about.

00:27:48.837 --> 00:27:49.921 align:middle line:84%
Okay, that hurt.

00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:51.840 align:middle line:90%
You just stepped on my toes,
that didn't feel good.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.342 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

00:27:54.342 --> 00:27:56.261 align:middle line:90%
- Where's the virus?
- I didn't ask to dance.

00:27:56.261 --> 00:27:58.054 align:middle line:90%
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

00:27:58.054 --> 00:27:59.305 align:middle line:84%
No? How do you know that?

00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:01.099 align:middle line:84%
Where shall I start?

00:28:01.099 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:84%
There's two types of CIA agents.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence and espionage.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.645 align:middle line:90%
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

00:28:05.645 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what intelligence agents look like.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.899 align:middle line:90%
You look like you could
pick up a building.

00:28:09.899 --> 00:28:11.401 align:middle line:84%
But espionage is about blending in

00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:12.485 align:middle line:84%
and about being subtle,

00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:16.948 align:middle line:84%
and there is nothing subtle about you.

00:28:16.948 --> 00:28:18.366 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

00:28:18.366 --> 00:28:20.326 align:middle line:84%
That's good.

00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:22.161 align:middle line:90%
- I'm impressed.
- I didn't kill anybody.

00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:25.123 align:middle line:84%
I know you didn't.

00:28:25.123 --> 00:28:26.332 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that, then?

00:28:26.332 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you can learn a lot

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.835 align:middle line:84%
about somebody when you fight them.

00:28:28.835 --> 00:28:30.753 align:middle line:84%
And when we fought,

00:28:30.753 --> 00:28:32.338 align:middle line:84%
you weren't fighting to kill me.

00:28:32.338 --> 00:28:35.091 align:middle line:84%
You were fighting to run away.

00:28:35.091 --> 00:28:36.509 align:middle line:84%
But either way, the world thinks that

00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:37.886 align:middle line:84%
you're a murderer and a thief,

00:28:37.886 --> 00:28:39.012 align:middle line:84%
so you're not going anywhere

00:28:39.012 --> 00:28:40.263 align:middle line:84%
or getting any goddamn phone call

00:28:40.263 --> 00:28:41.598 align:middle line:84%
until you give me some real answers.

00:28:41.598 --> 00:28:43.183 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what is happening here.

00:28:43.183 --> 00:28:44.267 align:middle line:84%
Then tell me. Help me understand.

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:45.351 align:middle line:84%
I can't. You're wasting my time.

00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:46.728 align:middle line:90%
Then I can't either...
You're wasting time!

00:28:46.728 --> 00:29:01.326 align:middle line:90%
Virus gets in the wrong hands,
that's it. It's game over.

00:29:01.326 --> 00:29:03.036 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean it's time for curls?

00:29:03.036 --> 00:29:05.914 align:middle line:90%
Just like the CIA,
always flexing the wrong muscle.

00:29:05.914 --> 00:29:07.457 align:middle line:90%
You know, the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body.

00:29:07.457 --> 00:29:08.583 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should try exercising that

00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:10.835 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more.

00:29:10.835 --> 00:29:12.462 align:middle line:84%
"There's more wisdom in your body

00:29:12.462 --> 00:29:14.339 align:middle line:84%
"than in your deepest philosophies."

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:16.925 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, let me guess. That Bruce Lee?

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:19.594 align:middle line:84%
No, Nietzsche.

00:29:19.594 --> 00:29:21.888 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I'm flexing this.

00:29:21.888 --> 00:29:25.934 align:middle line:84%
And all of that.

00:29:25.934 --> 00:29:28.061 align:middle line:84%
Come here.

00:29:28.061 --> 00:29:29.938 align:middle line:84%
If she moves, I want you to shoot her.

00:29:29.938 --> 00:29:31.439 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he can't shoot me.

00:29:31.439 --> 00:29:33.233 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, not allowed.
- In the face.

00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:34.734 align:middle line:90%
You can't. Not in the face.
You'd go to prison.

00:29:34.734 --> 00:29:35.902 align:middle line:84%
You can shoot her right in the face.

00:29:35.902 --> 00:29:37.278 align:middle line:84%
No, you can't. You'd go to prison. Sorry.

00:29:37.278 --> 00:29:41.366 align:middle line:90%
I want you to shoot her
two times right in that face.

00:29:41.366 --> 00:29:49.707 align:middle line:90%
- Okay?
- Yeah.

00:29:49.707 --> 00:29:50.792 align:middle line:84%
Hi, Dad.

00:29:50.792 --> 00:29:52.293 align:middle line:84%
Did you catch the hot spy lady?

00:29:52.293 --> 00:29:54.921 align:middle line:90%
Come on. It's me.
I catch everybody I hunt.

00:29:54.921 --> 00:29:57.382 align:middle line:84%
How long have you been doing this?

00:29:57.382 --> 00:30:05.557 align:middle line:84%
'Cause you seem... new.

00:30:05.557 --> 00:30:07.016 align:middle line:84%
She's actually quite annoying.

00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:08.476 align:middle line:84%
You know, Dad,

00:30:08.476 --> 00:30:10.311 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people annoy each other

00:30:10.311 --> 00:30:12.730 align:middle line:84%
when they're actually, like, flirting.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:17.318 align:middle line:84%
Where'd you hear that from?

00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:18.403 align:middle line:84%
Okay, look,

00:30:18.403 --> 00:30:20.405 align:middle line:90%
uh, me and the spy lady,
we're not flirting, all right?

00:30:20.405 --> 00:30:36.171 align:middle line:84%
Zero chemistry.

00:30:36.171 --> 00:30:37.547 align:middle line:84%
I don't know.

00:30:37.547 --> 00:30:38.715 align:middle line:84%
When you saw her photo,

00:30:38.715 --> 00:30:40.466 align:middle line:84%
you definitely gave the eyebrow.

00:30:40.466 --> 00:30:41.801 align:middle line:84%
What eyebrow?

00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:43.553 align:middle line:84%
You know, Dad, that thing that you do.

00:30:43.553 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:84%
What thing?

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.223 align:middle line:90%
- I don't do that.
- Yes, you do.

00:30:47.223 --> 00:30:49.184 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't... I definitely don't do that.

00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:50.268 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what you're doing.

00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:52.353 align:middle line:84%
That's the silliest thing I've ever seen.

00:30:52.353 --> 00:30:54.355 align:middle line:90%
Let me get going,
I got business to take care of.

00:30:54.355 --> 00:30:56.816 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you when I get home, okay?
I love you.

00:30:56.816 --> 00:30:57.901 align:middle line:84%
Love you.

00:30:57.901 --> 00:31:04.115 align:middle line:84%
Hey, one more thing.

00:31:04.115 --> 00:31:13.541 align:middle line:84%
Goddamn it.

00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:15.126 align:middle line:90%
This is not the dance
you wanna do with me, woman.

00:31:15.126 --> 00:31:17.378 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, really?
- I eat bullets all day long.

00:31:17.378 --> 00:31:20.215 align:middle line:90%
Oh, for breakfast and lunch?
'Cause it's dinnertime.

00:31:20.215 --> 00:31:22.008 align:middle line:84%
I'll count down for you. Three...

00:31:22.008 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:90%
- Two...
- Hobbs.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.803 align:middle line:90%
- Freeze.
- Put that down.

00:31:25.803 --> 00:31:27.764 align:middle line:90%
Get your greasy
sausage fingers off of her.

00:31:27.764 --> 00:31:30.391 align:middle line:90%
- What are you doing here?
- Saving you.

00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:31.726 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be saved.

00:31:31.726 --> 00:31:33.520 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no. This is my house

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.146 align:middle line:90%
and your goddamn girlfriend
ain't going anywhere.

00:31:35.146 --> 00:31:36.981 align:middle line:90%
- That's disgusting.
- "Girlfriend"?

00:31:36.981 --> 00:31:41.361 align:middle line:84%
That is my sister.

00:31:41.361 --> 00:31:42.445 align:middle line:84%
Bullshit.

00:31:42.445 --> 00:31:43.571 align:middle line:84%
She's too good-looking to be your sister.

00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:44.822 align:middle line:84%
Very funny. Hat.

00:31:44.822 --> 00:31:47.033 align:middle line:90%
- There are people after you.
- Believe me, I know that.

00:31:47.033 --> 00:31:48.117 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna stay that way

00:31:48.117 --> 00:31:49.369 align:middle line:84%
unless you tell me where that virus is.

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Listen to me, pinhead.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.747 align:middle line:90%
She's gonna die if I don't
get her out of here right now!

00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:53.831 align:middle line:84%
We're all gonna die

00:31:53.831 --> 00:31:55.041 align:middle line:90%
if she doesn't tell us
where that weapon is.

00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:58.336 align:middle line:90%
Actually, everyone's gonna die
'cause I am the virus!

00:31:58.336 --> 00:31:59.754 align:middle line:84%
It's embedded in capsules.

00:31:59.754 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I need to find a way to get them out.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:59.397 align:middle line:84%
Bag the asset.

00:32:59.397 --> 00:33:00.481 align:middle line:84%
Now or never.

00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:01.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm more of a now type of guy.

00:33:01.858 --> 00:33:04.319 align:middle line:90%
- On my three.
- Sure.

00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:08.281 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three.

00:33:08.281 --> 00:34:32.156 align:middle line:84%
No one tells me what to do.

00:34:32.156 --> 00:34:51.092 align:middle line:84%
Now I take you to school, son.

00:34:51.092 --> 00:34:53.845 align:middle line:90%
Deckard Shaw.
It's been a long time.

00:34:53.845 --> 00:34:55.138 align:middle line:84%
Good to see you, Brixton.

00:34:55.138 --> 00:34:57.015 align:middle line:84%
I think you're out of bullets there, son.

00:34:57.015 --> 00:34:58.099 align:middle line:84%
Lucky for you, I am.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:35:00.894 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

00:35:00.894 --> 00:35:02.562 align:middle line:90%
- Nice suit.
- Bulletproof.

00:35:02.562 --> 00:35:04.314 align:middle line:90%
- State of the art.
- Could've done with that

00:35:04.314 --> 00:35:05.648 align:middle line:84%
the last time I put a bullet in ya.

00:35:05.648 --> 00:35:07.192 align:middle line:84%
No, actually, it was three bullets.

00:35:07.192 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Two to the chest, one to the head.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.862 align:middle line:84%
Just like they taught us. Do you remember?

00:35:10.862 --> 00:35:12.822 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame you didn't join Eteon.

00:35:12.822 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
You could've had all this, my friend.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:90%
- "Friend"?
- Yeah.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.913 align:middle line:90%
- You're not the man I knew.
- No. I am way better.

00:35:19.913 --> 00:35:48.441 align:middle line:84%
I'm the future of mankind.

00:35:48.441 --> 00:35:50.068 align:middle line:84%
Stop!

00:35:50.068 --> 00:35:53.112 align:middle line:84%
Stop!

00:35:53.112 --> 00:35:55.281 align:middle line:84%
Hattie, get in the car.

00:35:55.281 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all going.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.701 align:middle line:84%
Not you.

00:35:58.701 --> 00:36:00.453 align:middle line:84%
Just the girl.

00:36:00.453 --> 00:36:11.548 align:middle line:84%
I said, we're all going.

00:36:11.548 --> 00:36:35.905 align:middle line:84%
Disable the car. I need the girl alive.

00:36:35.905 --> 00:36:37.574 align:middle line:84%
What the hell did you do, Hattie?

00:36:37.574 --> 00:36:39.075 align:middle line:84%
A big brother lecture now, really? Huh?

00:36:39.075 --> 00:36:40.201 align:middle line:84%
I injected myself. I didn't have a choice.

00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:53.923 align:middle line:84%
He was gonna take it.

00:36:53.923 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Program intercepting vector.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:38:19.092 align:middle line:84%
You might wanna...

00:38:19.092 --> 00:38:22.929 align:middle line:84%
Might be time for some curls.

00:38:22.929 --> 00:38:28.351 align:middle line:84%
Let go of me.

00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:32.564 align:middle line:84%
Very good.

00:38:32.564 --> 00:38:33.648 align:middle line:84%
You wanna tell me

00:38:33.648 --> 00:38:35.525 align:middle line:90%
just what in the fresh turkey hell
we're dealing with here?

00:38:35.525 --> 00:38:37.026 align:middle line:84%
Long story.

00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:39.279 align:middle line:84%
He's a ghost. Supposed to be dead.

00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:41.531 align:middle line:90%
Eight years ago,
I put a bullet through his brain.

00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Great, so we're being chased
by the Terminator.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.914 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he's gonna make it.

00:38:49.914 --> 00:38:51.583 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't think he can see
over the steering wheel.

00:38:51.583 --> 00:39:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Buckle up, fat boy,
I'm gonna save your life again.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.687 align:middle line:84%
You want a war, then?

00:39:54.687 --> 00:40:09.827 align:middle line:84%
Okay.

00:40:09.827 --> 00:40:19.921 align:middle line:84%
Okay, ride's over. We gotta lose this car.

00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:21.464 align:middle line:84%
Update.

00:40:21.464 --> 00:40:23.007 align:middle line:84%
I've hacked the mainframe

00:40:23.007 --> 00:40:24.884 align:middle line:84%
of every news agency and outlet.

00:40:24.884 --> 00:40:26.094 align:middle line:84%
How many do we control?

00:40:26.094 --> 00:40:28.471 align:middle line:90%
Hundred and seventy-four
broadcasts, 2,000 odd.

00:40:28.471 --> 00:40:31.015 align:middle line:90%
Double it.
I want 100% control of this story.

00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:33.059 align:middle line:90%
- Standard frame job.
- No, standard will not do.

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:34.644 align:middle line:84%
I need something special for these guys.

00:40:34.644 --> 00:40:36.437 align:middle line:84%
So listen up. Narrative:

00:40:36.437 --> 00:40:41.234 align:middle line:90%
Hobbs, Shaw, big guy,
little guy, have been ID'd.

00:40:41.234 --> 00:40:44.737 align:middle line:90%
They've been blamed for
the recent attacks on the CIA.

00:40:44.737 --> 00:40:47.699 align:middle line:90%
They shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:51.411 align:middle line:84%
to start their reign of terror.

00:40:51.411 --> 00:40:55.331 align:middle line:84%
Just got real.

00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:57.083 align:middle line:84%
Who the hell are these guys?

00:40:57.083 --> 00:40:59.586 align:middle line:84%
Eteon. They're a secret tech cult,

00:40:59.586 --> 00:41:02.797 align:middle line:90%
with a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money.

00:41:02.797 --> 00:41:04.424 align:middle line:84%
And delusions of saving the world

00:41:04.424 --> 00:41:06.259 align:middle line:84%
by augmenting the human race.

00:41:06.259 --> 00:41:07.677 align:middle line:84%
That's it.

00:41:07.677 --> 00:41:09.387 align:middle line:84%
Apparently they control the media as well.

00:41:09.387 --> 00:41:11.806 align:middle line:84%
Heard rumors about these people.

00:41:11.806 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks they're a myth.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.477 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it firsthand
how real they are.

00:41:16.477 --> 00:41:18.021 align:middle line:84%
If you don't fit into their plans,

00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:19.522 align:middle line:84%
you've already dug your own grave.

00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:21.149 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's get to the
nearest lockdown facility...

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:23.109 align:middle line:84%
Hey, no, no, no. You don't get it, do you?

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:24.819 align:middle line:84%
Brixton's a tier-one assassin.

00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:26.696 align:middle line:84%
Best I've ever seen. I know him.

00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:90%
He ain't never gonna stop
until he gets that virus.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.785 align:middle line:90%
And besides, that's my sister.
Family business.

00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Is your name Shaw? No.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Then she's going nowhere with you.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.706 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the fate of the world,

00:41:36.706 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:84%
it becomes my business.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.042 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if she's your sister,

00:41:39.042 --> 00:41:40.251 align:middle line:84%
that woman ain't going anywhere...

00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:41.377 align:middle line:90%
- Where are you going?
- I'm going away.

00:41:41.377 --> 00:41:43.129 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time for your
alpha male shit right now.

00:41:43.129 --> 00:41:44.214 align:middle line:84%
You're both idiots.

00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:45.381 align:middle line:84%
You clearly can't work together

00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:47.133 align:middle line:84%
and so you're absolutely useless to me.

00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:48.468 align:middle line:84%
So I'm gonna go find the man

00:41:48.468 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:90%
who can help me get this thing
out of my system.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.349 align:middle line:90%
- See ya.
- You mean this man?

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:56.184 align:middle line:84%
I was tracking him before the attack.

00:41:56.184 --> 00:41:58.353 align:middle line:90%
He's hard to find but I think
I got a hell of a lead.

00:41:58.353 --> 00:41:59.646 align:middle line:84%
Russian newspaper.

00:41:59.646 --> 00:42:01.231 align:middle line:84%
Not just any old paper.

00:42:01.231 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:90%
There's only one place
in London that sells that.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.154 align:middle line:84%
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

00:42:08.154 --> 00:42:19.082 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit optimistic.

00:42:19.082 --> 00:42:25.797 align:middle line:84%
Call the director.

00:42:25.797 --> 00:42:29.175 align:middle line:84%
Well, well, Deckard Shaw.

00:42:29.175 --> 00:42:31.553 align:middle line:84%
How complicated for you.

00:42:31.553 --> 00:42:33.012 align:middle line:84%
Not really.

00:42:33.012 --> 00:42:36.516 align:middle line:84%
He's also working with DSS, Luke Hobbs.

00:42:36.516 --> 00:42:39.769 align:middle line:84%
Hobbs. We have a history.

00:42:39.769 --> 00:42:41.396 align:middle line:84%
They're formidable.

00:42:41.396 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Small fry.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.315 align:middle line:84%
I'll eliminate the two of them.

00:42:44.315 --> 00:42:45.775 align:middle line:84%
Get the asset back ASAP.

00:42:45.775 --> 00:42:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You get the girl,

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.987 align:middle line:84%
extract the virus

00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:51.447 align:middle line:84%
and reprogram it for phase one.

00:42:51.447 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We use that weapon to eliminate the weak

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.287 align:middle line:84%
and anyone who would get in our way.

00:42:57.287 --> 00:42:59.330 align:middle line:90%
We're building
the perfect system, Brixton.

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.876 align:middle line:90%
Hobbs and Shaw can be
considerable assets for Eteon.

00:43:02.876 --> 00:43:04.294 align:middle line:84%
Turn them.

00:43:04.294 --> 00:43:05.962 align:middle line:84%
"Turn 'em"?

00:43:05.962 --> 00:43:08.089 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I don't follow.

00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:09.757 align:middle line:84%
I want them turned.

00:43:09.757 --> 00:43:11.634 align:middle line:84%
I want them working for the cause.

00:43:11.634 --> 00:43:13.386 align:middle line:84%
Understood?

00:43:13.386 --> 00:43:15.263 align:middle line:84%
They can't be turned.

00:43:15.263 --> 00:43:17.473 align:middle line:84%
What makes you so certain?

00:43:17.473 --> 00:43:19.517 align:middle line:90%
The last time we asked,
I got shot in the face.

00:43:19.517 --> 00:43:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That makes me very certain.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.981 align:middle line:90%
So, I suggest
that we take another approach.

00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:26.065 align:middle line:84%
Which is why...

00:43:26.065 --> 00:43:27.483 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking, Brixton.

00:43:27.483 --> 00:43:29.777 align:middle line:84%
You show them the consequences of refusal.

00:43:29.777 --> 00:43:32.989 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps I'll show them to you.

00:43:32.989 --> 00:43:34.699 align:middle line:84%
Is that a threat?

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:36.743 align:middle line:90%
I'd remember
who you're relying on

00:43:36.743 --> 00:43:39.746 align:middle line:84%
for your survival.

00:43:39.746 --> 00:43:45.919 align:middle line:84%
All for the cause.

00:43:45.919 --> 00:43:47.545 align:middle line:90%
Look, honey, I have to talk
to you about something.

00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:48.713 align:middle line:84%
It's very important right now.

00:43:48.713 --> 00:43:49.964 align:middle line:84%
Remember how we spoke about

00:43:49.964 --> 00:43:51.341 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if things went sideways?

00:43:51.341 --> 00:43:54.719 align:middle line:90%
We called it a "code red."
Well, it's happening.

00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:56.262 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything I can do?

00:43:56.262 --> 00:43:58.765 align:middle line:90%
You need to stay home.
You're gonna be safe there.

00:43:58.765 --> 00:44:00.558 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we've got the CIA

00:44:00.558 --> 00:44:02.977 align:middle line:84%
listening in on this call right now.

00:44:02.977 --> 00:44:04.729 align:middle line:84%
Watch this. Hi, Locke.

00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:06.231 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's safe, everybody's great.

00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:08.483 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually at, uh, our old diner here.

00:44:08.483 --> 00:44:12.695 align:middle line:90%
It's super weird being here
without you guys.

00:44:12.695 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Think it's closed.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.242 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, brother.

00:44:17.242 --> 00:44:18.785 align:middle line:84%
Honey, I've already talked to Aunt Lisa.

00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:20.036 align:middle line:84%
She knows exactly what to do.

00:44:20.036 --> 00:44:22.664 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna be home as soon as I can.

00:44:22.664 --> 00:44:26.417 align:middle line:90%
- Love you.
- I love you back.

00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:29.462 align:middle line:84%
Goodbye.

00:44:29.462 --> 00:44:32.841 align:middle line:84%
Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw.

00:44:32.841 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
While Hobbs is an agent in the American...

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.596 align:middle line:84%
Tell us everything you know about this.

00:44:38.596 --> 00:44:40.974 align:middle line:84%
My God.

00:44:40.974 --> 00:44:43.142 align:middle line:90%
- When were you exposed?
- About 30 hours ago.

00:44:43.142 --> 00:44:45.645 align:middle line:90%
Then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact.

00:44:45.645 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So we need to neutralize it.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.314 align:middle line:84%
No, it is not that easy.

00:44:48.314 --> 00:44:50.775 align:middle line:84%
It's not programmed to any DNA sequence.

00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's fatal to everyone.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.070 align:middle line:84%
In 42 hours, the capsules will dissolve,

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.154 align:middle line:84%
and she will be infected.

00:44:55.154 --> 00:44:57.365 align:middle line:84%
Then the virus will go airborne.

00:44:57.365 --> 00:45:00.618 align:middle line:90%
We are talking global
contamination within a week.

00:45:00.618 --> 00:45:02.537 align:middle line:90%
Why in the hell would you
create something like that?

00:45:02.537 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought I was one of them.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.164 align:middle line:84%
Eteon.

00:45:05.164 --> 00:45:06.249 align:middle line:84%
They told me they wanted to

00:45:06.249 --> 00:45:07.584 align:middle line:84%
save the world through science.

00:45:07.584 --> 00:45:09.085 align:middle line:84%
I believed in their cause.

00:45:09.085 --> 00:45:12.547 align:middle line:90%
I developed the Snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines,

00:45:12.547 --> 00:45:14.299 align:middle line:84%
a panacea for the whole world.

00:45:14.299 --> 00:45:17.802 align:middle line:90%
But they redeveloped it into
a programmable apocalypse.

00:45:17.802 --> 00:45:19.429 align:middle line:84%
To attack the weakest of us.

00:45:19.429 --> 00:45:22.348 align:middle line:90%
Those not worthy of Eteon's
vision of the future.

00:45:22.348 --> 00:45:24.475 align:middle line:90%
For a scientist,
you seem incredibly stupid.

00:45:24.475 --> 00:45:26.436 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm a two-times Nobel Prize winner,

00:45:26.436 --> 00:45:27.687 align:middle line:84%
but who's counting?

00:45:27.687 --> 00:45:30.064 align:middle line:90%
All right, you said
the virus is programmable.

00:45:30.064 --> 00:45:31.774 align:middle line:84%
So... reprogram it.

00:45:31.774 --> 00:45:33.818 align:middle line:84%
I can't reprogram it in a host.

00:45:33.818 --> 00:45:35.361 align:middle line:90%
Just tell us how to get
this thing out from me.

00:45:35.361 --> 00:45:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are two options.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And the first is easy.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.283 align:middle line:90%
- Go.
- Finally.

00:45:40.283 --> 00:45:41.868 align:middle line:90%
- You kill her.
- Excuse me?

00:45:41.868 --> 00:45:43.119 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and burn the body, of course.

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:44.454 align:middle line:90%
- Of course.
- Of course.

00:45:44.454 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean really burn it.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.040 align:middle line:90%
- Really burn it.
- To ash.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:90%
- To ash?
- Beyond all recognition.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.503 align:middle line:90%
Let's assume that that's not an option,
shall we, genius?

00:45:51.503 --> 00:45:53.213 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it doesn't work for us.
Option number two.

00:45:53.213 --> 00:45:55.048 align:middle line:90%
There is a machine
that could preserve her life

00:45:55.048 --> 00:45:56.132 align:middle line:84%
and extract the virus.

00:45:56.132 --> 00:45:57.509 align:middle line:84%
That should've been option number one.

00:45:57.509 --> 00:45:59.177 align:middle line:84%
Because it's impossible to get to.

00:45:59.177 --> 00:46:01.554 align:middle line:90%
We'll decide what's impossible.
Where is it?

00:46:01.554 --> 00:46:03.181 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Eteon laboratory

00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:04.516 align:middle line:84%
where the Snowflake was developed.

00:46:04.516 --> 00:46:07.477 align:middle line:90%
A secret dark-tech complex
fortified by an army

00:46:07.477 --> 00:46:10.188 align:middle line:90%
in the most godforsaken
part of the planet.

00:46:10.188 --> 00:46:12.357 align:middle line:90%
But if you go there,
all three of you will die.

00:46:12.357 --> 00:46:13.858 align:middle line:84%
So basically what you're saying is

00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:17.362 align:middle line:84%
she dies no matter what.

00:46:17.362 --> 00:46:20.615 align:middle line:84%
Well, who needs a drink?

00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:39.968 align:middle line:84%
I know just the place.

00:46:39.968 --> 00:46:42.804 align:middle line:84%
Wow, look at all these.

00:46:42.804 --> 00:46:44.764 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's overcompensating.

00:46:44.764 --> 00:46:48.893 align:middle line:84%
If anything, I'm under-compensating.

00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:53.565 align:middle line:90%
And a teeny-tiny one.
Just your size.

00:46:53.565 --> 00:46:56.359 align:middle line:84%
Used it for a job over in Italy.

00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:59.362 align:middle line:90%
Shame we didn't need
a weightlifting bus driver.

00:46:59.362 --> 00:47:09.873 align:middle line:84%
Would've given you a call.

00:47:09.873 --> 00:47:11.749 align:middle line:84%
Drink?

00:47:11.749 --> 00:47:29.976 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll take a little one.

00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:32.145 align:middle line:90%
I'll write to someone in Moscow.
An old friend.

00:47:32.145 --> 00:47:34.063 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we have a long history.

00:47:34.063 --> 00:47:36.357 align:middle line:90%
She and her crew are paying
a visit to some locals.

00:47:36.357 --> 00:47:38.151 align:middle line:84%
Particular Russian criminal element.

00:47:38.151 --> 00:47:39.694 align:middle line:84%
They have things that we're gonna need.

00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:40.945 align:middle line:84%
Considering your history with friends,

00:47:40.945 --> 00:47:42.405 align:middle line:90%
how many bullets you put
in this one's head?

00:47:42.405 --> 00:47:43.698 align:middle line:84%
They can set us up with gear,

00:47:43.698 --> 00:47:44.949 align:middle line:84%
and I don't hear any other ideas.

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:46.826 align:middle line:90%
You know as well as I do
getting out of this country

00:47:46.826 --> 00:47:48.203 align:middle line:84%
is gonna be extremely difficult.

00:47:48.203 --> 00:47:49.996 align:middle line:84%
We have every major intelligence agency

00:47:49.996 --> 00:47:51.247 align:middle line:84%
already hunting us down.

00:47:51.247 --> 00:47:53.082 align:middle line:90%
And there's the fact
that you disgraced MI6

00:47:53.082 --> 00:48:01.508 align:middle line:84%
when you betrayed your team.

00:48:01.508 --> 00:48:05.136 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe everything
they tell you, Hat.

00:48:05.136 --> 00:48:11.476 align:middle line:84%
Smile.

00:48:11.476 --> 00:48:13.353 align:middle line:90%
No, regular back channels
aren't gonna work this time.

00:48:13.353 --> 00:48:14.938 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna have to
do our best to blend in.

00:48:14.938 --> 00:48:16.314 align:middle line:84%
Hide in plain sight.

00:48:16.314 --> 00:48:18.191 align:middle line:84%
That's why we'll be flying commercial.

00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:19.317 align:middle line:84%
Commercial? We're gonna get spotted

00:48:19.317 --> 00:48:21.653 align:middle line:84%
too easy at...

00:48:21.653 --> 00:48:23.905 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry that pea-sized brain.
I handled it.

00:48:23.905 --> 00:48:25.949 align:middle line:90%
Cloned our cell phone signals
around the world.

00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:27.992 align:middle line:84%
Should buy us at least 48 hours.

00:48:27.992 --> 00:48:29.661 align:middle line:90%
We'll pick up new gear
when we get to Moscow.

00:48:29.661 --> 00:48:32.413 align:middle line:90%
Should get us past the
wandering eyes at the airport.

00:48:32.413 --> 00:48:36.209 align:middle line:90%
This is probably the only thing
that's gonna fit.

00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:37.877 align:middle line:84%
Fit what, a Smurf?

00:48:37.877 --> 00:48:39.504 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of my old ones.

00:48:39.504 --> 00:48:40.672 align:middle line:84%
I apologize in advance

00:48:40.672 --> 00:48:43.591 align:middle line:84%
if it's a little loose around the balls.

00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:46.302 align:middle line:84%
Okay. What do we got, tough guy? Come on.

00:48:46.302 --> 00:48:47.679 align:middle line:84%
I've created new identities

00:48:47.679 --> 00:48:49.347 align:middle line:84%
and altered your biometric profiles

00:48:49.347 --> 00:48:50.849 align:middle line:84%
so the airport scanners don't recognize

00:48:50.849 --> 00:48:52.308 align:middle line:84%
your faces or your fingerprints.

00:48:52.308 --> 00:48:54.894 align:middle line:90%
You're Sarah Atkins.
You work in insurance.

00:48:54.894 --> 00:48:59.023 align:middle line:84%
Hello.

00:48:59.023 --> 00:49:01.192 align:middle line:90%
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:49:01.192 --> 00:49:02.819 align:middle line:84%
I'm Franz Gruber.

00:49:02.819 --> 00:49:06.614 align:middle line:90%
I'm a freelance architect,
avid mountain climber,

00:49:06.614 --> 00:49:10.952 align:middle line:84%
and a part-time ski instructor.

00:49:10.952 --> 00:49:12.036 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.

00:49:12.036 --> 00:49:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And you, you're Michael Oxmaul.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:23.965 align:middle line:84%
"Mike Oxmaul."

00:49:23.965 --> 00:49:26.801 align:middle line:84%
I go by Michael.

00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:27.886 align:middle line:90%
- Freeze!
- Stay right where you are!

00:49:27.886 --> 00:49:29.846 align:middle line:90%
- Stop, sir! Stop there!
- Stay there!

00:49:29.846 --> 00:49:31.431 align:middle line:84%
It's Mike. It's Mike Oxmaul.

00:49:31.431 --> 00:49:34.142 align:middle line:84%
It's not small. And my name's Michael.

00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:36.436 align:middle line:84%
They've stopped him for what, exactly?

00:49:36.436 --> 00:49:38.521 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is,
it's gonna involve rubber gloves

00:49:38.521 --> 00:49:40.356 align:middle line:84%
and a body cavity search.

00:49:40.356 --> 00:49:44.736 align:middle line:84%
Let's go.

00:49:44.736 --> 00:49:54.078 align:middle line:84%
Hands on your head, Oxmaul.

00:49:54.078 --> 00:49:55.788 align:middle line:84%
Can't believe you did that.

00:49:55.788 --> 00:50:00.293 align:middle line:84%
He was gonna slow us down.

00:50:00.293 --> 00:50:03.213 align:middle line:84%
We can't pull this off. We both know it.

00:50:03.213 --> 00:50:04.756 align:middle line:90%
It's bad enough
I got this thing in my blood

00:50:04.756 --> 00:50:06.216 align:middle line:84%
that's gonna kill me and everyone else,

00:50:06.216 --> 00:50:08.426 align:middle line:90%
but were you seriously gonna
break this mysterious machine

00:50:08.426 --> 00:50:11.095 align:middle line:90%
out of some high-security
death virus complex

00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:12.805 align:middle line:84%
and magically get it to work?

00:50:12.805 --> 00:50:14.015 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, that sounds completely...

00:50:14.015 --> 00:50:17.352 align:middle line:84%
You still wear that silly thing?

00:50:17.352 --> 00:50:19.896 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know you still had that.

00:50:19.896 --> 00:50:22.607 align:middle line:84%
Put the pin back in.

00:50:22.607 --> 00:50:27.403 align:middle line:84%
You haven't changed.

00:50:27.403 --> 00:50:29.531 align:middle line:84%
Wish I could say the same about you.

00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:32.492 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

00:50:32.492 --> 00:50:36.371 align:middle line:90%
We're gonna make this work.
It's what we do.

00:50:36.371 --> 00:50:40.083 align:middle line:84%
And what if we don't?

00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:41.501 align:middle line:84%
What if the only option is for you to...

00:50:41.501 --> 00:50:44.003 align:middle line:84%
It's not happening.

00:50:44.003 --> 00:50:50.927 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm here. I'm Michael.

00:50:50.927 --> 00:50:52.762 align:middle line:84%
Hi, yeah.

00:50:52.762 --> 00:50:56.182 align:middle line:84%
Hello. All right.

00:50:56.182 --> 00:51:00.478 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, let's see. Where's my seat?

00:51:00.478 --> 00:51:04.190 align:middle line:84%
F-one, F-two...

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.944 align:middle line:84%
F you.

00:51:07.944 --> 00:51:12.866 align:middle line:84%
Hey.

00:51:12.866 --> 00:51:15.368 align:middle line:84%
You are an asshole.

00:51:15.368 --> 00:51:16.661 align:middle line:84%
You were quicker than I thought.

00:51:16.661 --> 00:51:18.538 align:middle line:84%
Yup. Because I have a secret weapon.

00:51:18.538 --> 00:51:20.832 align:middle line:84%
People actually like me.

00:51:20.832 --> 00:51:21.916 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't understand that

00:51:21.916 --> 00:51:28.506 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have any friends.

00:51:28.506 --> 00:52:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I love your babushka.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.545 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't have booked an emergency row

00:52:07.545 --> 00:52:08.838 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit more legroom, huh?

00:52:08.838 --> 00:52:11.549 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has hobbit legs like you.

00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Hey, look, in case you didn't realize,

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.387 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't give a damn about your comfort.

00:52:16.387 --> 00:52:18.348 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you be a good elephant,

00:52:18.348 --> 00:52:20.475 align:middle line:84%
suck up another kilo of peanuts,

00:52:20.475 --> 00:52:22.519 align:middle line:84%
put your chair back and relax?

00:52:22.519 --> 00:52:24.229 align:middle line:90%
All right, listen,
don't ever tell me to relax, all right?

00:52:24.229 --> 00:52:25.313 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell me to do anything.

00:52:25.313 --> 00:52:26.731 align:middle line:84%
Any time you ever say anything,

00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:28.024 align:middle line:84%
it makes me want to take my boot

00:52:28.024 --> 00:52:29.317 align:middle line:84%
and shove it so far up your ass,

00:52:29.317 --> 00:52:31.110 align:middle line:90%
you're gonna be spitting out
shoelaces all week.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.821 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you know what the problem is?

00:52:33.821 --> 00:52:36.199 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you the problem. This job.

00:52:36.199 --> 00:52:38.785 align:middle line:84%
This job requires stealth.

00:52:38.785 --> 00:52:41.579 align:middle line:84%
And you... look at you.

00:52:41.579 --> 00:52:44.624 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted, it's not your fault.

00:52:44.624 --> 00:52:46.084 align:middle line:84%
But you're too obvious.

00:52:46.084 --> 00:52:50.421 align:middle line:84%
You stick out. Like balls on a bulldog.

00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:53.132 align:middle line:84%
Dangling down in all the wrong places.

00:52:53.132 --> 00:52:57.095 align:middle line:84%
Seemingly harmless.

00:52:57.095 --> 00:52:58.179 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,

00:52:58.179 --> 00:53:00.181 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to impregnate your sister.

00:53:00.181 --> 00:53:02.809 align:middle line:84%
What?

00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:06.229 align:middle line:90%
- Impregnate your sister?
- You heard.

00:53:06.229 --> 00:53:09.107 align:middle line:84%
Oh.

00:53:09.107 --> 00:53:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I get it.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.610 align:middle line:84%
You do? Good. I'm glad.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.279 align:middle line:90%
Mmm-hmm?
- Yeah, I'm glad.

00:53:14.279 --> 00:53:15.822 align:middle line:90%
- I'm very glad.
- You actually think that

00:53:15.822 --> 00:53:18.366 align:middle line:90%
I'm going through all this effort,
on this mission,

00:53:18.366 --> 00:53:21.578 align:middle line:90%
trying to save the world,
by the way, for a fourth time,

00:53:21.578 --> 00:53:23.204 align:middle line:84%
because I'm really good at it.

00:53:23.204 --> 00:53:24.581 align:middle line:84%
You think I'm going through all of this

00:53:24.581 --> 00:53:26.624 align:middle line:84%
just so I can do the horizontal-hula,

00:53:26.624 --> 00:53:28.626 align:middle line:84%
sexy, sexy time with your sister?

00:53:28.626 --> 00:53:31.004 align:middle line:84%
Not all. Most.

00:53:31.004 --> 00:53:32.463 align:middle line:84%
Let me break it down for you, Frodo.

00:53:32.463 --> 00:53:34.841 align:middle line:84%
This ain't 1955 anymore, all right?

00:53:34.841 --> 00:53:36.467 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact that that girl

00:53:36.467 --> 00:53:38.136 align:middle line:84%
sleeping right there is related to you,

00:53:38.136 --> 00:53:39.512 align:middle line:84%
she's still one of the toughest,

00:53:39.512 --> 00:53:41.181 align:middle line:84%
baddest, most capable women

00:53:41.181 --> 00:53:43.349 align:middle line:84%
I've ever encountered in my entire life.

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:46.769 align:middle line:84%
And if she chooses to look the way

00:53:46.769 --> 00:53:49.606 align:middle line:84%
of this big, brown,

00:53:49.606 --> 00:53:54.527 align:middle line:84%
well-endowed, tattooed mountain of a man,

00:53:54.527 --> 00:53:56.196 align:middle line:84%
then guess what.

00:53:56.196 --> 00:53:58.489 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna let her climb this mountain

00:53:58.489 --> 00:54:03.244 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again.

00:54:03.244 --> 00:54:05.413 align:middle line:84%
You stay away from her.

00:54:05.413 --> 00:54:08.583 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're doing.
You think I'm stupid?

00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:09.834 align:middle line:84%
Of course I think you're stupid.

00:54:09.834 --> 00:54:11.085 align:middle line:84%
But you know what? I'll do you a favor.

00:54:11.085 --> 00:54:12.504 align:middle line:90%
I'll knock that dumb
right out of your skull.

00:54:12.504 --> 00:54:13.713 align:middle line:84%
You just say the word, jack.

00:54:13.713 --> 00:54:14.881 align:middle line:84%
You know what I wanna do?

00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:16.257 align:middle line:84%
I wanna do an Irish jig

00:54:16.257 --> 00:54:19.469 align:middle line:84%
on your arse-ugly face at 30,000 feet.

00:54:19.469 --> 00:54:20.929 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, 30,000 feet.
- Yeah.

00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:22.514 align:middle line:90%
- So you wanna dance right now?
- Yeah.

00:54:22.514 --> 00:54:25.058 align:middle line:90%
The only thing holding you back
is air and opportunity.

00:54:25.058 --> 00:54:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And there goes the air.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.020 align:middle line:90%
- Bring it on, Don Ho.
- "Don Ho"?

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.980 align:middle line:84%
That's enough! Hey, cut it out.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.482 align:middle line:84%
Both of y'all, cut it out.

00:54:32.482 --> 00:54:34.442 align:middle line:84%
Oh, see? You woke up the air marshal.

00:54:34.442 --> 00:54:35.818 align:middle line:84%
You woke the air marshal.

00:54:35.818 --> 00:54:37.111 align:middle line:84%
How'd you know I was the air marshal?

00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:38.780 align:middle line:90%
- Unaccompanied.
- Late boarding the plane.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.114 align:middle line:84%
Aisle seat.

00:54:40.114 --> 00:54:43.284 align:middle line:84%
Golf shirt.

00:54:43.284 --> 00:54:46.079 align:middle line:84%
Let's just call that an educated guess.

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:48.081 align:middle line:84%
Air Marshal Dinkley, at your service.

00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, did you just say "Dinkley"?

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:53.127 align:middle line:84%
What's the problem? Dinkley.

00:54:53.127 --> 00:54:54.546 align:middle line:84%
I understand this big fella,

00:54:54.546 --> 00:54:56.214 align:middle line:84%
because it's my job to observe.

00:54:56.214 --> 00:54:57.966 align:middle line:84%
Thick neck, your head's been on a swivel

00:54:57.966 --> 00:54:59.634 align:middle line:84%
since you've been on this damn plane.

00:54:59.634 --> 00:55:02.428 align:middle line:90%
Every passenger that's got on here
you been checking out.

00:55:02.428 --> 00:55:03.638 align:middle line:84%
You're a lawman.

00:55:03.638 --> 00:55:07.475 align:middle line:84%
And you, Mr. Armani pants, you're a spy.

00:55:07.475 --> 00:55:09.060 align:middle line:90%
- He's pretty good.
- Not bad.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I get it. We're all big guys.

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.939 align:middle line:84%
The three of us. Alphas.

00:55:12.939 --> 00:55:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Three apex predators cooped up in the sky.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.609 align:middle line:84%
Tensions get high.

00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:17.944 align:middle line:90%
What you throwing up
on the bench, big fella?

00:55:17.944 --> 00:55:20.071 align:middle line:84%
Three, four hundred pounds?

00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:22.365 align:middle line:90%
- Little less.
- Yeah, light work.

00:55:22.365 --> 00:55:25.243 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the same thing. Slugging weight.

00:55:25.243 --> 00:55:26.703 align:middle line:84%
Clanging and banging.

00:55:26.703 --> 00:55:28.037 align:middle line:84%
What you into?

00:55:28.037 --> 00:55:30.081 align:middle line:84%
Hot yoga? Pilates?

00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Probably mess around in the Octagon.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.543 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you wanna know what I do?

00:55:33.543 --> 00:55:36.462 align:middle line:84%
I sit in a can of farts all day long.

00:55:36.462 --> 00:55:37.964 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm dealing with.

00:55:37.964 --> 00:55:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It's an occasional terrorist
and a lot of recycled ass.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.595 align:middle line:90%
I would give anything
to be on the front line again.

00:55:43.595 --> 00:55:45.096 align:middle line:84%
"Again"?

00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:46.181 align:middle line:84%
What?

00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:47.765 align:middle line:84%
I was a compartmented element for JSOC.

00:55:47.765 --> 00:55:48.892 align:middle line:84%
You were in Delta?

00:55:48.892 --> 00:55:51.102 align:middle line:84%
Sabre Squad Echo, 24/7, baby.

00:55:51.102 --> 00:55:52.854 align:middle line:84%
"Echo"? Those guys were the warlocks

00:55:52.854 --> 00:55:54.230 align:middle line:84%
because of the magic they could do.

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:55.648 align:middle line:90%
- That's right.
- If that's the case,

00:55:55.648 --> 00:55:57.483 align:middle line:84%
then I'mma say "abracadabra," bitches.

00:55:57.483 --> 00:55:59.277 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at the magic.

00:55:59.277 --> 00:56:02.697 align:middle line:90%
You know what your problem is?
Your balance is off.

00:56:02.697 --> 00:56:04.157 align:middle line:84%
You need a third squaddie.

00:56:04.157 --> 00:56:05.366 align:middle line:90%
- No, no, we're good.
- No.

00:56:05.366 --> 00:56:06.701 align:middle line:84%
Guys, I know the game.

00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:09.787 align:middle line:90%
You hear me?
I know the game.

00:56:09.787 --> 00:56:10.872 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing?

00:56:10.872 --> 00:56:11.998 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, "What am I doing?"

00:56:11.998 --> 00:56:14.542 align:middle line:90%
- Don't talk like that.
- You sound different.

00:56:14.542 --> 00:56:16.294 align:middle line:90%
- Do I?
- That's not your voice.

00:56:16.294 --> 00:56:17.378 align:middle line:84%
Use your regular voice.

00:56:17.378 --> 00:56:20.089 align:middle line:84%
This is my regular voice.

00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:22.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking like the warlocks talk, baby.

00:56:22.467 --> 00:56:23.676 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk like that.

00:56:23.676 --> 00:56:24.761 align:middle line:84%
I'm just showing you.

00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:84%
That's all, guys. Look,

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.764 align:middle line:84%
all I'm saying is I could complete

00:56:27.764 --> 00:56:29.516 align:middle line:84%
this holy trinity that you guys have.

00:56:29.516 --> 00:56:31.434 align:middle line:84%
Three would be too much.

00:56:31.434 --> 00:56:33.102 align:middle line:84%
Here's my rÃ©sumÃ©. This is my card.

00:56:33.102 --> 00:56:34.437 align:middle line:84%
'Cause if you need stuff,

00:56:34.437 --> 00:56:36.397 align:middle line:90%
I'm the guy that you call
to get what you need.

00:56:36.397 --> 00:56:38.066 align:middle line:84%
You want a Citation X? You want a GV?

00:56:38.066 --> 00:56:39.275 align:middle line:84%
You want a Boeing 747?

00:56:39.275 --> 00:56:42.529 align:middle line:90%
You want a helicopter?
You want something stealth?

00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:51.454 align:middle line:84%
I'm an air marshal. I'm your guy.

00:56:51.454 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Please. Please let me go.

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.422 align:middle line:84%
What do you want?

00:57:01.422 --> 00:57:03.591 align:middle line:90%
I want our property
out of that girl's blood.

00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:16.479 align:middle line:84%
No, the virus is too dangerous. I can't!

00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Humans must evolve, Professor.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.567 align:middle line:84%
Without Eteon's upgrades,

00:57:20.567 --> 00:57:23.820 align:middle line:90%
the human body's
really not worth that much.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.364 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 11 pence worth of magnesium,

00:57:26.364 --> 00:57:28.491 align:middle line:84%
couple of pence worth of calcium,

00:57:28.491 --> 00:57:30.994 align:middle line:84%
little bit of iron.

00:57:30.994 --> 00:57:32.662 align:middle line:84%
Not worth much.

00:57:32.662 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, all in all,
probably about three pound.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.003 align:middle line:84%
Three pound fifty, max.

00:57:40.003 --> 00:57:45.466 align:middle line:90%
The entirety of a man's worth,
small change.

00:57:45.466 --> 00:57:48.386 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna reprogram that virus for me.

00:57:48.386 --> 00:58:14.954 align:middle line:84%
I won't.

00:58:14.954 --> 00:58:17.749 align:middle line:90%
Ah, your friend's
a Russian mobster.

00:58:17.749 --> 00:58:20.210 align:middle line:90%
This girl steals
from Russian mobsters.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.462 align:middle line:84%
Actually, she steals from everyone.

00:58:22.462 --> 00:58:33.932 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of her thing.

00:58:33.932 --> 00:58:36.518 align:middle line:84%
Deckard Shaw.

00:58:36.518 --> 00:58:56.496 align:middle line:84%
Margarita.

00:58:56.496 --> 00:58:58.915 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I did not see that coming.

00:58:58.915 --> 00:59:01.751 align:middle line:84%
I wish I didn't see that at all.

00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:03.753 align:middle line:84%
Me too.

00:59:03.753 --> 00:59:05.713 align:middle line:84%
I got your list.

00:59:05.713 --> 00:59:07.841 align:middle line:84%
It's long.

00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:09.676 align:middle line:84%
I asked for a house on a runway.

00:59:09.676 --> 00:59:12.929 align:middle line:90%
Not sure a dozen Russians
in duct tape were on the list.

00:59:12.929 --> 00:59:14.889 align:middle line:84%
Well, give me more than three-hour notice,

00:59:14.889 --> 00:59:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and I wouldn't have to
resort to such extremes.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.227 align:middle line:84%
Not sure three hours has anything to do

00:59:19.227 --> 00:59:22.605 align:middle line:84%
with your extremes, Margarita.

00:59:22.605 --> 00:59:24.774 align:middle line:84%
QuÃ© mierda, Deckard.

00:59:24.774 --> 00:59:28.194 align:middle line:90%
Eteon. Could you pick
a harder place to break into?

00:59:28.194 --> 00:59:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to find the C-17
viral extraction machine.

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.948 align:middle line:84%
Could be anywhere.

00:59:31.948 --> 00:59:34.492 align:middle line:90%
That facility is three square miles
of research labs.

00:59:34.492 --> 00:59:37.871 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. And it's a powder keg
packed with munitions.

00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:40.498 align:middle line:84%
We've gotta pull a Mick Jagger.

00:59:40.498 --> 00:59:41.708 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like a fun game.

00:59:41.708 --> 00:59:43.751 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting you on the inside. No.

00:59:43.751 --> 00:59:45.044 align:middle line:84%
When Deck and I were kids,

00:59:45.044 --> 00:59:46.880 align:middle line:90%
we'd spend our time
coming up with these grifts.

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.590 align:middle line:84%
A "Mick Jagger" was a job

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:50.383 align:middle line:84%
that required one person to showboat

00:59:50.383 --> 00:59:54.137 align:middle line:90%
to draw all the eyes while
the others made the music.

00:59:54.137 --> 00:59:58.850 align:middle line:84%
A typical inside job.

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.435 align:middle line:84%
Guys, you heard Andreiko.

01:00:00.435 --> 01:00:02.103 align:middle line:84%
They have to use the extraction machine.

01:00:02.103 --> 01:00:04.439 align:middle line:84%
So they'll take me right to it.

01:00:04.439 --> 01:00:06.941 align:middle line:84%
No, I can do it.

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:09.027 align:middle line:84%
We can do it.

01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:10.403 align:middle line:84%
So now the only question is

01:00:10.403 --> 01:00:12.530 align:middle line:84%
how to ring Eteon's dinner bell.

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.157 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can handle that part.

01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:18.578 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's get you geared up.

01:00:18.578 --> 01:00:22.957 align:middle line:84%
These are your HALO parachutes.

01:00:22.957 --> 01:00:25.835 align:middle line:84%
Earbuds for encrypted communication.

01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:29.964 align:middle line:84%
Scorpion EVO 3 with optical sights.

01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:32.842 align:middle line:84%
Ultra-thin bullet-resisting Kevlar.

01:00:32.842 --> 01:00:35.803 align:middle line:84%
Infrared cameras for seeing through walls.

01:00:35.803 --> 01:00:37.555 align:middle line:84%
And last but not least,

01:00:37.555 --> 01:00:39.933 align:middle line:84%
compact hydrogen detonator.

01:00:39.933 --> 01:00:44.521 align:middle line:90%
Put it in the right spot,
it'll blow the place sky-high.

01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:46.731 align:middle line:84%
How do I look?

01:00:46.731 --> 01:00:55.365 align:middle line:84%
Looks a little tight.

01:00:55.365 --> 01:00:57.825 align:middle line:84%
How you holding up?

01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.494 align:middle line:84%
You know, if things go south in there,

01:00:59.494 --> 01:01:02.956 align:middle line:84%
you can't leave me alive.

01:01:02.956 --> 01:01:05.291 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna get you out of there.

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you something else.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.628 align:middle line:84%
"The key to immortality

01:01:08.628 --> 01:01:12.715 align:middle line:90%
"is first living a life
worth remembering."

01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:15.260 align:middle line:90%
- Is that more Nietzsche?
- Nah.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.097 align:middle line:84%
That's Bruce Lee.

01:01:19.097 --> 01:01:28.481 align:middle line:84%
Come on.

01:01:28.481 --> 01:01:30.275 align:middle line:84%
How'd you find her?

01:01:30.275 --> 01:01:32.986 align:middle line:90%
You've heard about me.
I'm good at my job.

01:01:32.986 --> 01:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Was she alone?

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.866 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

01:01:37.866 --> 01:01:40.410 align:middle line:90%
If you're lying to me,
I will cut your heart out.

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:43.496 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand?

01:01:43.496 --> 01:02:16.821 align:middle line:84%
I'd be afraid if I had one.

01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:18.031 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a ride.

01:02:18.031 --> 01:02:19.532 align:middle line:84%
What a ride.

01:02:19.532 --> 01:02:21.159 align:middle line:84%
I got shotgun.

01:02:21.159 --> 01:02:23.578 align:middle line:90%
- I got shotgun.
- No, no, no. Don't start.

01:02:23.578 --> 01:02:30.251 align:middle line:84%
I got shotgun.

01:02:30.251 --> 01:02:31.628 align:middle line:84%
We're entering the drop zone!

01:02:31.628 --> 01:02:34.047 align:middle line:90%
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

01:02:34.047 --> 01:02:35.256 align:middle line:90%
- On my three!
- Okay.

01:02:35.256 --> 01:02:37.342 align:middle line:90%
- One!
- Uh-uh.

01:02:37.342 --> 01:02:48.645 align:middle line:90%
- You asshole!
- Whoo!

01:02:48.645 --> 01:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Nobody tells me what to do.

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.791 align:middle line:90%
So, I'm intrigued,
do you wash the blood off your hands

01:03:09.791 --> 01:03:22.053 align:middle line:90%
before you count your money
or is it afterwards?

01:03:22.053 --> 01:03:24.681 align:middle line:84%
Dismissed.

01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:26.015 align:middle line:84%
You don't get it, do you?

01:03:26.015 --> 01:03:28.142 align:middle line:84%
You know, the weak deal with money.

01:03:28.142 --> 01:03:30.687 align:middle line:84%
We deal with evolutionary change.

01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:33.314 align:middle line:90%
Change that sometimes require
acts of violence.

01:03:33.314 --> 01:03:35.233 align:middle line:84%
Like killing innocent people with viruses?

01:03:35.233 --> 01:03:36.401 align:middle line:84%
Only the weak ones.

01:03:36.401 --> 01:03:38.194 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with the future
of the planet.

01:03:38.194 --> 01:03:39.779 align:middle line:84%
Things that money cannot buy.

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:42.407 align:middle line:84%
Oh, like your soul back?

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
My soul?

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.661 align:middle line:84%
Your brother took my soul.

01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:48.997 align:middle line:84%
The boys in the lab made me a new one.

01:03:48.997 --> 01:04:07.765 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's progress.

01:04:07.765 --> 01:04:13.271 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the
extraction room, Miss Shaw.

01:04:13.271 --> 01:04:16.566 align:middle line:84%
Get her ready.

01:04:16.566 --> 01:04:24.282 align:middle line:84%
It won't be long.

01:04:24.282 --> 01:04:25.825 align:middle line:90%
I tell you,
we ain't gonna want to be here

01:04:25.825 --> 01:04:28.953 align:middle line:84%
when this thing goes off.

01:04:28.953 --> 01:04:31.372 align:middle line:84%
Looks like she's 400 yards through there.

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:33.458 align:middle line:90%
Looks like they're holding her
in some sort of medical pod.

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:36.252 align:middle line:90%
Timer's set for 45 minutes.
We get in and get out.

01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:38.087 align:middle line:84%
Blow this death factory to pieces.

01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:39.255 align:middle line:84%
Remember the hallway.

01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
No guns.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Right. Those guys have to be alive.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:43.134 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of the hallway

01:04:43.134 --> 01:04:45.762 align:middle line:90%
the retinal scanner needs
a match to open the door.

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:47.555 align:middle line:90%
- Pick a door.
- I'm right there.

01:04:47.555 --> 01:04:48.723 align:middle line:84%
Nope, that's my door.

01:04:48.723 --> 01:04:55.396 align:middle line:84%
What's the matter with you?

01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:57.774 align:middle line:84%
I made a mistake. This is your door.

01:04:57.774 --> 01:05:00.401 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no. No backsies. What's the matter?

01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:01.986 align:middle line:90%
You got a lot of bad guys
behind that door?

01:05:01.986 --> 01:05:40.024 align:middle line:84%
Watch this. You might learn something.

01:05:40.024 --> 01:06:38.416 align:middle line:84%
Watch this.

01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:41.044 align:middle line:84%
Enter corresponding match.

01:06:41.044 --> 01:06:43.421 align:middle line:84%

01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:47.759 align:middle line:84%

You come and do it!

01:07:17.622 --> 01:07:21.417 align:middle line:84%
Access granted.

01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Doors opening.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.222 align:middle line:84%
Very good. Well done, boys.

01:07:34.222 --> 01:07:54.367 align:middle line:84%
I'm impressed that you even got in here.

01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:57.704 align:middle line:90%
Is this your first day
on the Death Star?

01:07:57.704 --> 01:08:01.082 align:middle line:84%
The syringe is ready.

01:08:01.082 --> 01:08:04.502 align:middle line:84%
Because you seem... new.

01:08:04.502 --> 01:08:19.475 align:middle line:84%
This will shut her up.

01:08:19.475 --> 01:08:28.026 align:middle line:90%
That... That's...
That's not possible.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:29.402 align:middle line:84%
No. What are you doing?

01:08:29.402 --> 01:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Having to extract it myself.

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:59.098 align:middle line:84%
Wait!

01:08:59.098 --> 01:09:02.810 align:middle line:84%
There he is. Nice and rested?

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.062 align:middle line:84%
Get your full eight hours?

01:09:04.062 --> 01:09:06.856 align:middle line:84%
I was gonna order some room service.

01:09:06.856 --> 01:09:07.941 align:middle line:84%
What do you fancy?

01:09:07.941 --> 01:09:09.651 align:middle line:84%
French toast? I'll get the order in.

01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:12.862 align:middle line:90%
I just dreamt they killed you
before I woke up.

01:09:12.862 --> 01:09:14.489 align:middle line:84%
Pretty disappointed right now.

01:09:14.489 --> 01:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a little elaborate, I must admit.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.619 align:middle line:84%
Old-school interrogation technique

01:09:19.619 --> 01:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
we picked up in black ops.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.497 align:middle line:84%
Shock will kill a man in three.

01:09:22.497 --> 01:09:24.123 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that, Deck?

01:09:24.123 --> 01:09:26.709 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I remember
a lot of things from back then.

01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:28.962 align:middle line:90%
I reckon you've only got
four shocks in you, boys.

01:09:28.962 --> 01:09:30.713 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? I think we could take five.

01:09:30.713 --> 01:09:44.519 align:middle line:84%
"Five"? Well, all right.

01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:47.188 align:middle line:84%
You had to open your big mouth, didn't ya?

01:09:47.188 --> 01:10:07.333 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was a cool thing
to say in the moment.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:09.335 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember
when we were real brothers?

01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:12.046 align:middle line:90%
Task Force Black.
Do you remember that, Deck?

01:10:12.046 --> 01:10:14.424 align:middle line:90%
Man, we ended up
seeing the worst in people.

01:10:14.424 --> 01:10:16.467 align:middle line:84%
Worst in our countries, our leaders,

01:10:16.467 --> 01:10:19.137 align:middle line:84%
our enemies, our friends.

01:10:19.137 --> 01:10:20.972 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the meaning
of that word anymore.

01:10:20.972 --> 01:10:23.057 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry about it, neither does he.

01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:24.225 align:middle line:84%
He shoots them right in the head,

01:10:24.225 --> 01:10:26.436 align:middle line:90%
but in your case, I thought
it was hell of a good idea.

01:10:26.436 --> 01:10:27.604 align:middle line:84%
Big man, you still talking?

01:10:27.604 --> 01:10:35.904 align:middle line:90%
I said I thought it was
a hell of a good...

01:10:35.904 --> 01:10:37.947 align:middle line:84%
Oh!

01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:40.491 align:middle line:84%
Shit.

01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:42.952 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's funny how
humanity's hate for each other

01:10:42.952 --> 01:10:44.996 align:middle line:90%
is stronger than
its own self-preservation,

01:10:44.996 --> 01:10:46.331 align:middle line:84%
which is why we're here.

01:10:46.331 --> 01:10:47.707 align:middle line:84%
Remember eight years ago, Deck,

01:10:47.707 --> 01:10:49.959 align:middle line:84%
when Eteon asked us to join their mission?

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:52.378 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean their death cult.

01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:54.589 align:middle line:90%
- They're lunatics.
- Visionaries.

01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:56.257 align:middle line:84%
Visionaries of a future.

01:10:56.257 --> 01:10:58.343 align:middle line:84%
A bigger future. A brighter future.

01:10:58.343 --> 01:11:00.345 align:middle line:84%
You remember the data they gave us, man.

01:11:00.345 --> 01:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
What with environmental damage,

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.766 align:middle line:84%
capitalism, terrorism,

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.519 align:middle line:84%
humanity wipes itself out by 2096.

01:11:07.519 --> 01:11:09.062 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is scary to me.

01:11:09.062 --> 01:11:11.606 align:middle line:84%
But if we fulfill Eteon's vision,

01:11:11.606 --> 01:11:12.941 align:middle line:84%
you save their world.

01:11:12.941 --> 01:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't save the world with genocide.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.903 align:middle line:84%
Genocide, schmenocide.

01:11:16.903 --> 01:11:19.113 align:middle line:84%
You know what this virus is?

01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:35.839 align:middle line:90%
This virus is a necessary
shock to the system.

01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:39.092 align:middle line:84%
Whoo! That's three.

01:11:39.092 --> 01:11:40.176 align:middle line:84%
I love this thing.

01:11:40.176 --> 01:11:42.762 align:middle line:84%
Told you then, I'm telling you now,

01:11:42.762 --> 01:11:45.306 align:middle line:84%
your metrics are off.

01:11:45.306 --> 01:11:48.518 align:middle line:90%
One good reason:
You assume the worst in people.

01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:50.895 align:middle line:90%
People cannot be trusted
to do the right thing.

01:11:50.895 --> 01:11:52.021 align:middle line:84%
Look at the two of you.

01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:53.523 align:middle line:84%
The fate of the world is in your hands,

01:11:53.523 --> 01:11:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can't even get along.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
But you know all about
doing the right thing,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.866 align:middle line:84%
don't you, Shaw? Yeah.

01:12:02.866 --> 01:12:06.995 align:middle line:84%
Little souvenir, huh, bro?

01:12:06.995 --> 01:12:10.957 align:middle line:90%
You come to kill me,
I'll do the same every time.

01:12:10.957 --> 01:12:15.670 align:middle line:84%
What'd you expect? A shiatsu?

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:18.256 align:middle line:84%
Anyone talking to you?

01:12:18.256 --> 01:12:24.637 align:middle line:84%
Your mama.

01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:28.433 align:middle line:84%
Yeah!

01:12:28.433 --> 01:12:30.602 align:middle line:84%
I get it. You're still mad.

01:12:30.602 --> 01:12:34.606 align:middle line:90%
You're upset because,
hey, when you wouldn't turn,

01:12:34.606 --> 01:12:35.732 align:middle line:84%
they asked me to come and kill you

01:12:35.732 --> 01:12:36.816 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, I had to

01:12:36.816 --> 01:12:39.194 align:middle line:84%
because you knew too much.

01:12:39.194 --> 01:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
But I think about that night a lot.
I think about it.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Because what I realize now
that I did not realize then

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.411 align:middle line:90%
is that when you shot me,
you gave me a gift.

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:51.998 align:middle line:84%
Look at me. I'm black Superman.

01:12:51.998 --> 01:12:54.125 align:middle line:84%
Bulletproof, new spine,

01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:58.046 align:middle line:90%
and the more machine I become,
the more humane I am.

01:12:58.046 --> 01:13:00.548 align:middle line:84%
This is what you wanna fight for.

01:13:00.548 --> 01:13:03.468 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you another chance
to join us, Deckard.

01:13:03.468 --> 01:13:05.762 align:middle line:84%
And the boss wants big mouth as well.

01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:07.805 align:middle line:84%
If not, I kill you both.

01:13:07.805 --> 01:13:11.851 align:middle line:84%
Which, honestly, I'd love to do.

01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:14.687 align:middle line:90%
You know Eteon.
You know what they're capable of.

01:13:14.687 --> 01:13:17.815 align:middle line:84%
They rebuilt me. Dismantled him.

01:13:17.815 --> 01:13:19.776 align:middle line:84%
Made it look like he killed his own team.

01:13:19.776 --> 01:13:26.491 align:middle line:84%
Even your own sister... disowned you.

01:13:26.491 --> 01:13:27.742 align:middle line:84%
Just say the word, bro.

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:30.495 align:middle line:84%
Say the word and all of this goes away.

01:13:30.495 --> 01:13:32.956 align:middle line:84%
Your sister lives. His daughter lives.

01:13:32.956 --> 01:13:34.582 align:middle line:84%
We get you some upgrades,

01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:38.628 align:middle line:84%
and we go on to saving the world.

01:13:38.628 --> 01:13:39.754 align:middle line:84%
What's it to be?

01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:41.464 align:middle line:84%
Join the evolution of man,

01:13:41.464 --> 01:13:45.093 align:middle line:84%
or die with the weak?

01:13:45.093 --> 01:13:47.804 align:middle line:84%
Just get it done.

01:13:47.804 --> 01:13:50.932 align:middle line:90%
I told the boss
you wouldn't change your mind.

01:13:50.932 --> 01:13:52.016 align:middle line:84%
See you later.

01:13:52.016 --> 01:13:56.855 align:middle line:84%
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

01:13:56.855 --> 01:13:58.273 align:middle line:84%
I think we should join.

01:13:58.273 --> 01:14:01.943 align:middle line:84%
Join?

01:14:01.943 --> 01:14:04.112 align:middle line:84%
You said some really compelling things.

01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that black Superman thing,

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.156 align:middle line:84%
that really got me. I love that.

01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:09.701 align:middle line:90%
What are you, deaf, stupid, or both?
We ain't joining.

01:14:09.701 --> 01:14:11.286 align:middle line:90%
There you go again,
you're just thinking about yourself.

01:14:11.286 --> 01:14:12.537 align:middle line:84%
You're such a diva.

01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:14.289 align:middle line:84%
What about my feelings, for once?

01:14:14.289 --> 01:14:15.373 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you something,

01:14:15.373 --> 01:14:17.584 align:middle line:84%
if we were a band, you know who you'd be?

01:14:17.584 --> 01:14:18.918 align:middle line:84%
You'd be Mick Jagger.

01:14:18.918 --> 01:14:21.796 align:middle line:84%
"Mick Jagger"?

01:14:21.796 --> 01:14:23.339 align:middle line:84%
Mick Jagger.

01:14:23.339 --> 01:14:25.758 align:middle line:84%
Oi, what's it to be?

01:14:25.758 --> 01:14:32.223 align:middle line:84%
In or out?

01:14:32.223 --> 01:14:33.766 align:middle line:90%
- We're not gonna join.
- We're not gonna join.

01:14:33.766 --> 01:14:35.059 align:middle line:84%
But since you're standing there,

01:14:35.059 --> 01:14:36.436 align:middle line:84%
here's what I'm gonna do.

01:14:36.436 --> 01:14:38.188 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna rip the arm off this chair.

01:14:38.188 --> 01:14:40.064 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna smash him right in the face.

01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:42.025 align:middle line:90%
Stab him right in the neck
for looking that way.

01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:44.235 align:middle line:84%
Kill all 13 guys in seven seconds.

01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I'm gonna do.

01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:47.989 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna slip out of these
chains and dropkick him,

01:14:47.989 --> 01:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
him and him right in the throat.

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:54.037 align:middle line:90%
No, not him, that's my guy.
You gotta pick another guy.

01:14:54.037 --> 01:14:55.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean that's your guy?
That's my guy.

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:57.415 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no. That's face-smash guy.

01:14:57.415 --> 01:14:58.958 align:middle line:84%
You gotta find another dropkick guy.

01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:01.044 align:middle line:90%
You want a face-smash guy?
I'm gonna find you one.

01:15:01.044 --> 01:15:02.754 align:middle line:84%
See that guy over there?

01:15:02.754 --> 01:15:05.131 align:middle line:84%
The big one. The big one.

01:15:05.131 --> 01:15:07.133 align:middle line:90%
- That's face-smash guy.
- No, he's way too big.

01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:10.053 align:middle line:84%
Ain't that right, Hattie?

01:15:10.053 --> 01:15:11.179 align:middle line:84%
Let 'em go.

01:15:11.179 --> 01:15:15.600 align:middle line:90%
All right, boys, stay calm.
We need her alive.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.435 align:middle line:84%
Let them go, or what?

01:15:17.435 --> 01:15:19.562 align:middle line:90%
Or you're gonna get
a nice new breeze there

01:15:19.562 --> 01:15:20.813 align:middle line:84%
at the center of your forehead.

01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:23.316 align:middle line:84%
You're not gonna shoot me.

01:15:23.316 --> 01:15:26.319 align:middle line:90%
Because you need
an activation chip to fire that gun.

01:15:26.319 --> 01:15:27.695 align:middle line:84%
Sorry.

01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:33.743 align:middle line:84%
Try this gun!

01:15:33.743 --> 01:16:06.943 align:middle line:84%
I'm not small change.

01:16:06.943 --> 01:16:08.444 align:middle line:90%
- Let's roll.
- You think?

01:16:08.444 --> 01:16:46.024 align:middle line:84%
Dick.

01:16:46.024 --> 01:16:54.032 align:middle line:84%
There she is.

01:16:54.032 --> 01:16:56.659 align:middle line:90%
- Hattie, where's the machine?
- It's in the second truck.

01:16:56.659 --> 01:17:03.082 align:middle line:84%
On it.

01:17:03.082 --> 01:17:04.209 align:middle line:84%
Mick Jagger.

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:12.842 align:middle line:84%
Never fails.

01:17:12.842 --> 01:17:21.309 align:middle line:84%
We're not out of this yet, Hattie.

01:17:21.309 --> 01:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Got the machine.

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Get a move on!
Train's leaving the station!

01:17:51.840 --> 01:18:11.192 align:middle line:84%
That sumbitch really is black Superman.

01:18:11.192 --> 01:18:26.708 align:middle line:84%
Engage drones.

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We're running out of road.

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:38.595 align:middle line:84%
Hold on!

01:18:38.595 --> 01:19:06.414 align:middle line:84%
Route to intercept.

01:19:06.414 --> 01:19:16.382 align:middle line:84%
Ahh! Whoo!

01:19:16.382 --> 01:19:22.305 align:middle line:84%
On your left.

01:19:22.305 --> 01:19:48.122 align:middle line:84%
Brace yourself.

01:19:48.122 --> 01:19:51.292 align:middle line:84%
Hobbs, this ain't gonna make it.

01:19:51.292 --> 01:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Bringing her to ya.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.337 align:middle line:84%
You thinking what I'm thinking, Shaw?

01:19:54.337 --> 01:19:56.381 align:middle line:84%
Let's trade some paint.

01:19:56.381 --> 01:20:26.452 align:middle line:84%
Trade some paint.

01:20:26.452 --> 01:20:27.537 align:middle line:84%
Hattie.

01:20:27.537 --> 01:21:23.301 align:middle line:90%
- Huh?
- You trust me?

01:21:23.301 --> 01:21:24.928 align:middle line:84%
Gonna need a ride.

01:21:24.928 --> 01:21:26.387 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're thinking.

01:21:26.387 --> 01:21:39.651 align:middle line:84%
Just keep driving. I'll make it.

01:21:39.651 --> 01:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Take the wheel.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.211 align:middle line:84%
There he is.

01:21:58.211 --> 01:21:59.504 align:middle line:90%
- I got him.
- No, I got him.

01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:22.735 align:middle line:90%
- No, I got him.
- I got him.

01:22:22.735 --> 01:23:24.464 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were strong.

01:23:24.464 --> 01:23:26.007 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, brother.

01:23:26.007 --> 01:23:28.051 align:middle line:84%
This thing is really damaged.

01:23:28.051 --> 01:23:30.386 align:middle line:84%
Well, there goes option two.

01:23:30.386 --> 01:23:31.679 align:middle line:84%
That only leaves the first one.

01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:32.847 align:middle line:84%
Come on. Stop it, Hat.

01:23:32.847 --> 01:23:34.933 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired, Deck. I am done running.

01:23:34.933 --> 01:23:36.893 align:middle line:90%
- We still got time.
- "Time"?

01:23:36.893 --> 01:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Time for what? The machine's destroyed.

01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:40.438 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, well, we'll fix it.
- How?

01:23:40.438 --> 01:23:42.023 align:middle line:90%
We need to find a place
to get off the grid.

01:23:42.023 --> 01:23:43.983 align:middle line:90%
Where?
We're wanted all over the world,

01:23:43.983 --> 01:23:45.068 align:middle line:84%
and Brixton won't stop.

01:23:45.068 --> 01:23:46.152 align:middle line:84%
We can't risk millions of people.

01:23:46.152 --> 01:23:47.445 align:middle line:84%
I told you on the plane,

01:23:47.445 --> 01:23:48.613 align:middle line:84%
we should've gone with option one.

01:23:48.613 --> 01:23:49.697 align:middle line:84%
It is done now, Deck.

01:23:49.697 --> 01:23:51.241 align:middle line:90%
- It's not done.
- It's done.

01:23:51.241 --> 01:23:55.078 align:middle line:84%
It's not done!

01:23:55.078 --> 01:23:59.207 align:middle line:84%
It's not done.

01:23:59.207 --> 01:24:00.583 align:middle line:84%
Look at me.

01:24:00.583 --> 01:24:01.918 align:middle line:84%
Remember that thing you used to say to me

01:24:01.918 --> 01:24:04.003 align:middle line:84%
when we were kids? Huh?

01:24:04.003 --> 01:24:05.296 align:middle line:84%
Used to look at me and say,

01:24:05.296 --> 01:24:08.007 align:middle line:84%
"Deck, it's never over till it's over."

01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:11.386 align:middle line:84%
We used to laugh. Remember that?

01:24:11.386 --> 01:24:17.308 align:middle line:90%
No, Deck, it went, "It's never
over till I say it's over."

01:24:17.308 --> 01:24:21.396 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was it.

01:24:21.396 --> 01:24:24.774 align:middle line:84%
So say it now. Say it.

01:24:24.774 --> 01:24:26.901 align:middle line:84%
Remember who we are.

01:24:26.901 --> 01:24:29.779 align:middle line:84%
We're the Shaw family.

01:24:29.779 --> 01:24:37.245 align:middle line:84%
We never, never, never give up.

01:24:37.245 --> 01:24:40.331 align:middle line:84%
We've got a day.

01:24:40.331 --> 01:24:42.333 align:middle line:84%
More than a day.

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:46.504 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know where we'd go.

01:24:46.504 --> 01:24:50.216 align:middle line:84%
I know a place.

01:24:50.216 --> 01:24:51.676 align:middle line:84%
Where?

01:24:51.676 --> 01:24:57.348 align:middle line:90%
It's the last place on earth
I ever wanna go.

01:24:57.348 --> 01:25:18.369 align:middle line:84%
Home.

01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:20.079 align:middle line:84%
Abracadabra, bitches.

01:25:20.079 --> 01:25:22.081 align:middle line:84%
I told you that I could get you anything.

01:25:22.081 --> 01:25:24.501 align:middle line:84%
And listen to me, from Moscow to Samoa,

01:25:24.501 --> 01:25:26.169 align:middle line:84%
that is not an easy flight to charter,

01:25:26.169 --> 01:25:27.253 align:middle line:84%
but I got it done.

01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:28.755 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's why
we're calling you, Dinkley.

01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:29.839 align:middle line:84%
We just want to say thank you

01:25:29.839 --> 01:25:31.633 align:middle line:84%
for getting us that bird to Samoa.

01:25:31.633 --> 01:25:33.009 align:middle line:84%
Warriors help out warriors.

01:25:33.009 --> 01:25:34.385 align:middle line:84%
So all you need to know

01:25:34.385 --> 01:25:36.346 align:middle line:84%
is that you got a third squaddie over here

01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:39.098 align:middle line:90%
that is ready to go
whenever you need me to.

01:25:39.098 --> 01:25:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting in my lair.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.645 align:middle line:84%
You in a bathroom?

01:25:43.645 --> 01:25:45.021 align:middle line:84%
Potato, potah-to.

01:25:45.021 --> 01:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I am is where the magic happens.

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.399 align:middle line:84%
We ain't gotta get into specifics.

01:25:48.399 --> 01:25:50.151 align:middle line:90%
Just to make sure
you got all the contacts.

01:25:50.151 --> 01:25:53.071 align:middle line:84%
You got the cell, you got my e-mail.

01:25:53.071 --> 01:25:54.447 align:middle line:90%
- Got 'em all.
- Imma shoot you

01:25:54.447 --> 01:25:55.615 align:middle line:84%
my mom number too.

01:25:55.615 --> 01:25:56.741 align:middle line:84%
Imma make sure you got that,

01:25:56.741 --> 01:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
'cause if you can't get me, she can.

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:00.328 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.
- I got a Hotmail address

01:26:00.328 --> 01:26:01.704 align:middle line:84%
that's still active. Hit me on that.

01:26:01.704 --> 01:26:04.082 align:middle line:84%
LinkedIn. That's my profile.

01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:05.542 align:middle line:84%
...account thing I've been doing.

01:26:05.542 --> 01:26:06.835 align:middle line:84%
I'm just making sure you got everything...

01:26:06.835 --> 01:26:10.713 align:middle line:84%
We're losing ya.

01:26:10.713 --> 01:26:13.591 align:middle line:84%
That was my phone.

01:26:13.591 --> 01:26:14.884 align:middle line:84%
I hope this brother of yours

01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:17.512 align:middle line:84%
is as good a mechanic as you say he is.

01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:19.264 align:middle line:84%
Jonah is the best mechanic I know.

01:26:19.264 --> 01:26:20.974 align:middle line:84%
And he's gonna help us.

01:26:20.974 --> 01:26:41.077 align:middle line:84%
That is, if he doesn't kill me first.

01:26:41.077 --> 01:26:42.161 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, take your time.

01:26:42.161 --> 01:26:44.372 align:middle line:90%
It's only my sister's life
and the fate of the world

01:26:44.372 --> 01:26:48.668 align:middle line:84%
we're waiting on!

01:26:48.668 --> 01:26:49.752 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here we go.

01:26:49.752 --> 01:26:52.755 align:middle line:90%
Bet you a bullseye 50 quid
he punches him in the face.

01:26:52.755 --> 01:27:06.186 align:middle line:84%
Deal.

01:27:06.186 --> 01:27:09.355 align:middle line:84%
Jonah.

01:27:09.355 --> 01:27:12.066 align:middle line:84%
You know what comes next?

01:27:12.066 --> 01:27:16.404 align:middle line:84%
Yup.

01:27:16.404 --> 01:27:20.617 align:middle line:84%
See? Not just me.

01:27:20.617 --> 01:27:23.453 align:middle line:90%
Your face, it's all over
the bloody news, boy.

01:27:23.453 --> 01:27:25.079 align:middle line:84%
You're not welcome here, police.

01:27:25.079 --> 01:27:26.581 align:middle line:84%
You got a bloody cheek.

01:27:26.581 --> 01:27:29.209 align:middle line:84%
Coming here after 25 years.

01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:31.127 align:middle line:84%
Bringing your problems here to this house.

01:27:31.127 --> 01:27:34.130 align:middle line:90%
You betrayed our family,
bring shame on our house.

01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
You betrayed your own blood!

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.344 align:middle line:84%
Jonah, I hear you.

01:27:39.344 --> 01:27:40.428 align:middle line:84%
But we ain't kids anymore.

01:27:40.428 --> 01:27:41.513 align:middle line:84%
You better watch how you talk to me.

01:27:41.513 --> 01:27:44.098 align:middle line:90%
It's not the size of the dog
in the fight, boy.

01:27:44.098 --> 01:27:45.975 align:middle line:84%
It's the size of the fight in the dog.

01:27:45.975 --> 01:27:49.521 align:middle line:84%
No, it's always the size of the dog.

01:27:49.521 --> 01:27:53.775 align:middle line:90%
Hey! No fighting
under this roof, huh?

01:27:53.775 --> 01:27:58.071 align:middle line:84%
Is that my Luke?

01:27:58.071 --> 01:28:01.241 align:middle line:84%
My baby's home.

01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:03.243 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Mama.

01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:06.371 align:middle line:84%
Oka, I miss my baby boy.

01:28:06.371 --> 01:28:09.165 align:middle line:84%
But look at you, all skin and bones.

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:12.001 align:middle line:90%
- Come over here and eat.
- No, no, no, Mama.

01:28:12.001 --> 01:28:13.837 align:middle line:84%
There's no time.

01:28:13.837 --> 01:28:15.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to bring trouble here.

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:16.631 align:middle line:84%
You should've stayed away.

01:28:16.631 --> 01:28:18.341 align:middle line:84%
What did you bring here? What's going on?

01:28:18.341 --> 01:28:19.717 align:middle line:90%
- I brought the truth.
- What truth?

01:28:19.717 --> 01:28:20.927 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we were set up.

01:28:20.927 --> 01:28:23.179 align:middle line:90%
We were framed by people
who created a deadly virus.

01:28:23.179 --> 01:28:24.264 align:middle line:84%
Oh, come on.

01:28:24.264 --> 01:28:26.015 align:middle line:84%
It could go global if it's not stopped.

01:28:26.015 --> 01:28:27.809 align:middle line:84%
We could all die. All of us.

01:28:27.809 --> 01:28:29.936 align:middle line:90%
Everybody here in this fale,
everybody on the island.

01:28:29.936 --> 01:28:31.396 align:middle line:84%
And everybody around the world.

01:28:31.396 --> 01:28:33.565 align:middle line:90%
Jonah, I need you
to help fix this machine.

01:28:33.565 --> 01:28:35.191 align:middle line:84%
I need you to help my friends,

01:28:35.191 --> 01:28:37.485 align:middle line:90%
and I need us to build
defenses around here, now!

01:28:37.485 --> 01:28:38.987 align:middle line:84%
You think you can just come back in here

01:28:38.987 --> 01:28:40.071 align:middle line:84%
and we're gonna help you

01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:41.531 align:middle line:90%
- after everything you did?
- Yes!

01:28:41.531 --> 01:28:42.782 align:middle line:90%
- Not gonna happen!
- It's bigger than you and I!

01:28:42.782 --> 01:28:43.867 align:middle line:84%
I don't care!

01:28:43.867 --> 01:28:45.368 align:middle line:84%
It's bigger than you and I! We could die.

01:28:45.368 --> 01:28:48.955 align:middle line:90%
Good, because I would rather
die than help you, polo head!

01:28:48.955 --> 01:28:52.792 align:middle line:90%
Listen, I know your brother's
hard to be around, believe me.

01:28:52.792 --> 01:28:54.752 align:middle line:84%
But I trust him, and he brought us here

01:28:54.752 --> 01:28:56.254 align:middle line:84%
because this place has something

01:28:56.254 --> 01:28:59.174 align:middle line:84%
that nowhere else on the planet does: you.

01:28:59.174 --> 01:29:01.718 align:middle line:84%
You don't know me! I don't know you, okay?

01:29:01.718 --> 01:29:02.802 align:middle line:84%
Time for you all to go.

01:29:02.802 --> 01:29:04.762 align:middle line:90%
- Take your machine with you.
- Go, now!

01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:07.849 align:middle line:90%
- Go!
- Jonah Hobbs!

01:29:07.849 --> 01:29:10.185 align:middle line:84%
You have some respect for your uso.

01:29:10.185 --> 01:29:12.812 align:middle line:90%
If he needs anything,
we gonna give it to him.

01:29:12.812 --> 01:29:16.232 align:middle line:90%
The food off our tables,
the clothes off our backs,

01:29:16.232 --> 01:29:19.194 align:middle line:84%
even the mana of the island.

01:29:19.194 --> 01:29:23.072 align:middle line:84%
And you boys, all you boys,

01:29:23.072 --> 01:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you show our guests here fa'aaloalo,

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:30.163 align:middle line:90%
or so help me God,
I'm gonna take this here slipper

01:29:30.163 --> 01:29:32.874 align:middle line:84%
and I'm gonna sasa your big, fat heads!

01:29:32.874 --> 01:29:35.418 align:middle line:84%
You boys hear me?

01:29:35.418 --> 01:29:37.378 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to bring this here, Mama.

01:29:37.378 --> 01:29:40.256 align:middle line:84%
Luke, this is your home.

01:29:40.256 --> 01:29:57.815 align:middle line:84%
We Samoans. We can handle troubles.

01:29:57.815 --> 01:30:00.276 align:middle line:84%
You were right.

01:30:00.276 --> 01:30:03.905 align:middle line:84%
You don't turn soldiers like them.

01:30:03.905 --> 01:30:07.158 align:middle line:84%
Do what I built you to do.

01:30:07.158 --> 01:30:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You're a one-of-a-kind war machine.

01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:13.498 align:middle line:84%
Bring us back my virus.

01:30:13.498 --> 01:30:16.835 align:middle line:84%
No handcuffs this time.

01:30:16.835 --> 01:30:20.129 align:middle line:84%
You can have your revenge.

01:30:20.129 --> 01:30:22.131 align:middle line:84%
I will.

01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:24.676 align:middle line:90%
We found 'em.
They hopped an emergency cargo plane.

01:30:24.676 --> 01:30:26.553 align:middle line:90%
- To where?
- Samoa.

01:30:26.553 --> 01:30:30.515 align:middle line:90%
Gentlemen! This is where
you earn your upgrades.

01:30:30.515 --> 01:30:48.074 align:middle line:84%
Bring me back my virus.

01:30:48.074 --> 01:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:00.545 align:middle line:84%
It's quite the operation.

01:31:00.545 --> 01:31:03.089 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for a chop shop.

01:31:03.089 --> 01:31:04.549 align:middle line:84%
Your dad was a car thief, then?

01:31:04.549 --> 01:31:07.802 align:middle line:90%
Ah, no.
My dad actually stole everything.

01:31:07.802 --> 01:31:09.888 align:middle line:84%
Drugs. Guns...

01:31:09.888 --> 01:31:11.806 align:middle line:84%
Sounds just like my family.

01:31:11.806 --> 01:31:13.892 align:middle line:90%
Mama raised us
till we were teenagers,

01:31:13.892 --> 01:31:16.311 align:middle line:90%
and my old man
started coming around again.

01:31:16.311 --> 01:31:18.813 align:middle line:84%
Taking a real interest in his sons.

01:31:18.813 --> 01:31:21.983 align:middle line:90%
The truth is,
he was just looking for a new crew.

01:31:21.983 --> 01:31:27.989 align:middle line:90%
And I was the only one
to see through those lies.

01:31:27.989 --> 01:31:31.409 align:middle line:90%
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into

01:31:31.409 --> 01:31:35.496 align:middle line:84%
just got bigger and more dangerous.

01:31:35.496 --> 01:31:36.664 align:middle line:84%
Then eventually he knew,

01:31:36.664 --> 01:31:39.167 align:middle line:84%
and he was okay with,

01:31:39.167 --> 01:31:42.629 align:middle line:84%
getting me and my brothers killed.

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:43.963 align:middle line:84%
So I turned him in.

01:31:43.963 --> 01:31:49.761 align:middle line:84%
Or you protected your family.

01:31:49.761 --> 01:31:52.096 align:middle line:84%
So after I put him away,

01:31:52.096 --> 01:31:53.932 align:middle line:84%
I left Samoa and I never came back.

01:31:53.932 --> 01:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least one good thing came out

01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:58.186 align:middle line:84%
of me jamming that thing into my hand.

01:31:58.186 --> 01:32:00.063 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what's that?

01:32:00.063 --> 01:32:06.611 align:middle line:84%
Got to bring you home, didn't I?

01:32:06.611 --> 01:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Lucky me.

01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:15.828 align:middle line:84%
You went legit.

01:32:15.828 --> 01:32:18.039 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, 100% clean now.

01:32:18.039 --> 01:32:20.416 align:middle line:84%
Custom shop, international clients.

01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
See those bikes? Going to Tokyo.

01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:23.586 align:middle line:84%
And that car? New York.

01:32:23.586 --> 01:32:25.463 align:middle line:84%
That one over there's going to London.

01:32:25.463 --> 01:32:27.966 align:middle line:84%
Turns out people like our stuff.

01:32:27.966 --> 01:32:32.095 align:middle line:90%
I needed to do something
to hold our family together.

01:32:32.095 --> 01:32:38.351 align:middle line:84%
After you abandoned us.

01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:42.772 align:middle line:84%
Hey, good news. Change of clothes. Hats.

01:32:42.772 --> 01:32:44.566 align:middle line:84%
Your mum said you might like to wear this.

01:32:44.566 --> 01:32:48.653 align:middle line:84%
Must be your favorite size. Spray on.

01:32:48.653 --> 01:32:50.029 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you throw another jacket on?

01:32:50.029 --> 01:32:51.614 align:middle line:84%
It's 110 degrees out there.

01:32:51.614 --> 01:32:56.661 align:middle line:90%
Hey, look, down to business.
We got any weapons?

01:32:56.661 --> 01:33:05.879 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we got weapons.

01:33:05.879 --> 01:33:07.422 align:middle line:84%
Mama, where's all our guns?

01:33:07.422 --> 01:33:09.966 align:middle line:84%
I get rid of 'em.

01:33:09.966 --> 01:33:12.594 align:middle line:84%
Very noble, Mrs. Hobbs.

01:33:12.594 --> 01:33:13.761 align:middle line:84%
We're in serious trouble.

01:33:13.761 --> 01:33:15.597 align:middle line:84%
That is an understatement.

01:33:15.597 --> 01:33:20.602 align:middle line:84%
These guns, they kill all my family.

01:33:20.602 --> 01:33:22.145 align:middle line:84%
So we gonna fight.

01:33:22.145 --> 01:33:26.107 align:middle line:90%
Gonna fight with this
and we gonna fight with this.

01:33:26.107 --> 01:33:29.444 align:middle line:90%
'Cause no take a real man
for pull one trigger.

01:33:29.444 --> 01:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
All right, we're going to war
with the family heirlooms.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.574 align:middle line:84%
Got it. We're gonna need a lot more.

01:33:34.574 --> 01:33:37.076 align:middle line:84%
We're never gonna survive their firepower.

01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:39.329 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a man to pull a trigger,

01:33:39.329 --> 01:33:41.414 align:middle line:90%
but for Eteon,
it does take an activation chip.

01:33:41.414 --> 01:33:43.166 align:middle line:84%
You still got that glove?

01:33:43.166 --> 01:33:44.459 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking closed-system hack.

01:33:44.459 --> 01:33:46.211 align:middle line:84%
It'll level the playing field if you can.

01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Certainly buy us some time.

01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Shut their guns down.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm on it.

01:33:51.508 --> 01:33:55.136 align:middle line:84%
You ready?

01:33:55.136 --> 01:33:57.805 align:middle line:84%
War is what I do.

01:33:57.805 --> 01:34:00.725 align:middle line:84%
Let's go old-school.

01:34:00.725 --> 01:34:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Take a look around.

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:04.938 align:middle line:84%
This is where we draw the line.

01:34:04.938 --> 01:34:06.022 align:middle line:84%
Who would've thought

01:34:06.022 --> 01:34:08.024 align:middle line:84%
this is where we're gonna save the world?

01:34:08.024 --> 01:34:10.235 align:middle line:84%
We need to make 'em play by our rules.

01:34:10.235 --> 01:34:12.028 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow morning
there'll be a storm raging

01:34:12.028 --> 01:34:13.112 align:middle line:84%
on the north cliffs.

01:34:13.112 --> 01:34:14.906 align:middle line:84%
We'll build a no-man's-land there.

01:34:14.906 --> 01:34:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And if all else fails,
that'll be our last stand.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.830 align:middle line:84%
How many more of these we gotta do?

01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:24.999 align:middle line:84%
Just keep digging, brother.

01:34:24.999 --> 01:34:27.126 align:middle line:90%
When we were
in Kandahar running raids,

01:34:27.126 --> 01:34:29.796 align:middle line:90%
Brixton would always strike
just before dawn.

01:34:29.796 --> 01:34:31.422 align:middle line:84%
It's when the enemy's most tired,

01:34:31.422 --> 01:34:34.092 align:middle line:84%
still under the cover of night.

01:34:34.092 --> 01:34:35.718 align:middle line:84%
When the battle shifts into high gear,

01:34:35.718 --> 01:34:37.470 align:middle line:84%
you got the sun at your back.

01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:38.972 align:middle line:84%
We let 'em all in.

01:34:38.972 --> 01:34:40.807 align:middle line:84%
And we make sure they never leave.

01:34:40.807 --> 01:34:46.062 align:middle line:90%
Kill box. I like it.
Not like we got a ton of resources.

01:34:46.062 --> 01:36:28.706 align:middle line:84%
But the island will provide, brother.

01:36:28.706 --> 01:36:30.208 align:middle line:84%
Give me the good news, Hat.

01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:31.626 align:middle line:84%
I'm in. The only thing is,

01:36:31.626 --> 01:36:33.670 align:middle line:90%
I could only block the signal
repeaters on the satellite

01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:35.129 align:middle line:84%
for six minutes.

01:36:35.129 --> 01:36:37.799 align:middle line:84%
Six minutes might be all the time we need.

01:36:37.799 --> 01:36:39.217 align:middle line:84%
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.

01:36:39.217 --> 01:36:40.927 align:middle line:84%
Which is basically all we've got

01:36:40.927 --> 01:36:42.136 align:middle line:84%
to fight them with anyway.

01:36:42.136 --> 01:37:01.865 align:middle line:84%
Done more with less, haven't we?

01:37:01.865 --> 01:37:04.951 align:middle line:84%
Hi.

01:37:04.951 --> 01:37:12.125 align:middle line:90%
- Drink?
- Sure. Thank you.

01:37:12.125 --> 01:37:13.501 align:middle line:84%
Just taking it all in,

01:37:13.501 --> 01:37:22.468 align:middle line:84%
in case it's the last sunset we see.

01:37:22.468 --> 01:37:30.435 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have believed
that Deckard went dark.

01:37:30.435 --> 01:37:39.694 align:middle line:84%
Wasted so much time. I'm...

01:37:39.694 --> 01:37:44.115 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my whole life running away.

01:37:44.115 --> 01:37:45.783 align:middle line:84%
Me too.

01:37:45.783 --> 01:37:48.036 align:middle line:84%
Yeah?

01:37:48.036 --> 01:37:51.289 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

01:37:51.289 --> 01:37:52.957 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been back here in 25 years.

01:37:52.957 --> 01:37:57.462 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my own daughter
doesn't even know her family.

01:37:57.462 --> 01:38:06.054 align:middle line:84%
Well... you can change that.

01:38:06.054 --> 01:38:08.223 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

01:38:08.223 --> 01:38:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So can you.

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:12.477 align:middle line:84%
I got an idea. Why don't you and I

01:38:12.477 --> 01:38:14.771 align:middle line:84%
make a promise right here, right now?

01:38:14.771 --> 01:38:17.273 align:middle line:84%
That when we see tomorrow's sunset,

01:38:17.273 --> 01:38:30.203 align:middle line:84%
we begin to fix the mistakes we've made.

01:38:30.203 --> 01:38:36.709 align:middle line:90%
That's just sealed it so you
can't back out. That's all.

01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:38.419 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any chance in hell

01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:40.839 align:middle line:84%
I would back out.

01:38:40.839 --> 01:38:42.632 align:middle line:84%
You wanna seal it again or...

01:38:42.632 --> 01:38:44.717 align:middle line:90%
- Definitely not.
- Okay.

01:38:44.717 --> 01:38:49.305 align:middle line:84%
Maybe tomorrow, if I survive.

01:38:49.305 --> 01:38:50.890 align:middle line:90%
- Jonah.
- Look, don't rush me.

01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:53.518 align:middle line:90%
It's almost dawn.
He'll be here soon.

01:38:53.518 --> 01:38:55.603 align:middle line:84%
Make it happen now! Now!

01:38:55.603 --> 01:38:57.897 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey, don't rush me.
That's how mistakes are made.

01:38:57.897 --> 01:38:59.941 align:middle line:84%
And how long does this process take?

01:38:59.941 --> 01:39:02.235 align:middle line:84%
It's 30 minutes and 33 till I go viral.

01:39:02.235 --> 01:39:04.737 align:middle line:90%
Look, Deck, I think we need to
seriously consider option one.

01:39:04.737 --> 01:39:06.656 align:middle line:84%
Don't strike a match just yet, Hats.

01:39:06.656 --> 01:39:08.491 align:middle line:84%
We are seriously gonna miss this window.

01:39:08.491 --> 01:39:10.785 align:middle line:90%
- Let's do this. Come on!
- Jonah, now!

01:39:10.785 --> 01:39:14.831 align:middle line:84%
Fine, fine, okay. Here goes nothing.

01:39:14.831 --> 01:39:17.792 align:middle line:84%
Brace yourself, Hats.

01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:19.127 align:middle line:84%
It ain't gonna be pleasant.

01:39:19.127 --> 01:39:35.768 align:middle line:84%
No, it's gonna be fine.

01:39:35.768 --> 01:39:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It's working. It's working.

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:44.527 align:middle line:84%
Yeah!

01:39:44.527 --> 01:39:45.945 align:middle line:84%
Hey.

01:39:45.945 --> 01:39:47.614 align:middle line:84%
They triggered the alarm!

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:49.365 align:middle line:84%
That's him.

01:39:49.365 --> 01:39:55.914 align:middle line:90%
- As we planned?
- As we planned.

01:39:55.914 --> 01:40:01.044 align:middle line:84%
It's time.

01:40:01.044 --> 01:40:06.966 align:middle line:84%
Jonah.

01:40:06.966 --> 01:40:09.969 align:middle line:84%
Just wanna say that, uh...

01:40:09.969 --> 01:40:13.139 align:middle line:84%
if this thing goes sideways and...

01:40:13.139 --> 01:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is it...

01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:21.231 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry.

01:40:21.231 --> 01:40:26.653 align:middle line:90%
I may have had my reasons,
but the fact is...

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:33.952 align:middle line:84%
I left you and I left our 'aiga.

01:40:33.952 --> 01:40:36.496 align:middle line:84%
I should've come home.

01:40:36.496 --> 01:40:38.456 align:middle line:84%
If we make it through this,

01:40:38.456 --> 01:40:44.504 align:middle line:90%
you have my word I'll never
let that happen again.

01:40:44.504 --> 01:40:54.138 align:middle line:84%
I love you, uso.

01:40:54.138 --> 01:41:02.856 align:middle line:84%
I love you too, uso.

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:08.695 align:middle line:84%
Okay, you're mobile.

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.697 align:middle line:90%
Do you think I need to be
so close to the front line?

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:12.824 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we keep you close.
Keep an eye on you

01:41:12.824 --> 01:41:14.742 align:middle line:84%
in case we need to make a quick getaway.

01:41:14.742 --> 01:41:17.871 align:middle line:84%
Hey, this is what we do, right?

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:21.583 align:middle line:84%
It is what we do.

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:26.713 align:middle line:84%
Deck...

01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:31.092 align:middle line:84%
I overheard what Brixton said.

01:41:31.092 --> 01:41:35.597 align:middle line:84%
That you stayed away to protect us.

01:41:35.597 --> 01:41:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I never should've believed
all that stuff, I know it now.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.562 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I did. I'm so sorry.

01:41:42.562 --> 01:41:44.606 align:middle line:84%
Don't be.

01:41:44.606 --> 01:41:48.026 align:middle line:84%
Don't be. Hey, look, I've done things,

01:41:48.026 --> 01:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
done things I'm not proud of.

01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:54.741 align:middle line:84%
Things I... have to make amends for.

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:58.536 align:middle line:90%
All thanks to what
that bastard put me through.

01:41:58.536 --> 01:42:01.456 align:middle line:90%
But right now,
the most important thing to me

01:42:01.456 --> 01:42:34.822 align:middle line:84%
is getting my little sister home safely.

01:42:34.822 --> 01:42:53.299 align:middle line:84%
Eteon, hold!

01:42:53.299 --> 01:42:58.471 align:middle line:84%
Brothers of Samoa!

01:42:58.471 --> 01:43:07.856 align:middle line:84%
We call upon our Gods and ancestors

01:43:07.856 --> 01:43:14.988 align:middle line:90%
to ask for strength,
for now is the time for war!

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:18.157 align:middle line:84%
Rise!

01:43:18.157 --> 01:43:24.455 align:middle line:90%
- Do it.
- Light 'em up.

01:43:24.455 --> 01:43:28.960 align:middle line:84%
What's going on?

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.962 align:middle line:84%
How long before the guns get back online?

01:43:30.962 --> 01:43:33.339 align:middle line:84%
I've no idea.

01:43:33.339 --> 01:43:34.424 align:middle line:84%
Look into my eyes!

01:43:34.424 --> 01:43:44.225 align:middle line:90%
They will be the last thing
you see before you die!

01:43:44.225 --> 01:44:02.452 align:middle line:84%
To war!

01:44:02.452 --> 01:44:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Shaw.

01:44:09.250 --> 01:44:12.128 align:middle line:84%
Air command.

01:44:12.128 --> 01:45:24.367 align:middle line:84%
Bring me the chopper.

01:45:24.367 --> 01:45:44.387 align:middle line:84%
Deck!

01:45:44.387 --> 01:45:46.055 align:middle line:84%
Do it quick, Hats.

01:45:46.055 --> 01:45:47.849 align:middle line:84%
It's in, it's in, it's in. Is it working?

01:45:47.849 --> 01:45:50.852 align:middle line:84%
Machine's on.

01:45:50.852 --> 01:45:52.061 align:middle line:90%
- We're good.
- We're good.

01:45:52.061 --> 01:47:04.217 align:middle line:84%
Let's go.

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:29.033 align:middle line:84%
Hobbs!

01:47:29.033 --> 01:47:33.955 align:middle line:84%
Go, go!

01:47:33.955 --> 01:47:35.373 align:middle line:84%
Let's go fishing, Shaw.

01:47:35.373 --> 01:47:43.006 align:middle line:84%
You catch him, I'll gut him.

01:47:43.006 --> 01:48:06.237 align:middle line:84%
Hold on!

01:48:06.237 --> 01:48:21.503 align:middle line:90%
- Welcome to my island, you...
- Take it up!

01:48:21.503 --> 01:48:23.713 align:middle line:84%
You get us close and I'll get her.

01:48:23.713 --> 01:48:35.808 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep his nose down. You reel him in.

01:48:35.808 --> 01:48:47.195 align:middle line:84%
Take it up! Take it up!

01:48:47.195 --> 01:49:05.255 align:middle line:84%
Have a day off.

01:49:05.255 --> 01:49:06.840 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing?

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:13.513 align:middle line:84%
We're going for a ride.

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:14.973 align:middle line:84%
Shit.

01:49:14.973 --> 01:49:19.519 align:middle line:84%
We're coming, usos!

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:23.481 align:middle line:84%
Ha-ha!

01:49:23.481 --> 01:49:24.566 align:middle line:84%
Let's go, Jonah.

01:49:24.566 --> 01:49:27.694 align:middle line:84%
Come on, brother.

01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:48.173 align:middle line:84%
The axle, the axle!

01:49:48.173 --> 01:50:03.521 align:middle line:84%
Timo, you got this!

01:50:03.521 --> 01:50:05.857 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna need more weight.

01:50:05.857 --> 01:50:16.868 align:middle line:84%
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:50:16.868 --> 01:50:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Bring it in nice and easy, clean.

01:50:22.290 --> 01:50:26.544 align:middle line:84%
Hell yeah, usos!

01:50:26.544 --> 01:50:39.432 align:middle line:90%
- It's too much weight!
- All right, drop 'em.

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:46.272 align:middle line:84%
Stay there!

01:50:46.272 --> 01:51:15.009 align:middle line:84%
Hit 'em with the moonshine! Now!

01:51:15.009 --> 01:51:21.975 align:middle line:84%
Hang me off a cliff, huh? My turn.

01:51:21.975 --> 01:51:23.601 align:middle line:84%
Sir, the weapons are back online.

01:51:23.601 --> 01:51:26.229 align:middle line:84%
Let's go, let's go!

01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:28.857 align:middle line:84%
Goodbye.

01:51:28.857 --> 01:51:40.368 align:middle line:84%
Incoming!

01:51:40.368 --> 01:51:42.203 align:middle line:84%
We got a little trouble back here, Shaw.

01:51:42.203 --> 01:51:56.759 align:middle line:84%
We'll lose 'em in no-man's-land.

01:51:56.759 --> 01:52:15.278 align:middle line:84%
Let's get this up!

01:52:15.278 --> 01:52:31.419 align:middle line:84%
All right, now hit that stake.

01:52:31.419 --> 01:52:34.422 align:middle line:84%
We're losing the rotor!

01:52:34.422 --> 01:52:40.887 align:middle line:84%
Shit.

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:44.182 align:middle line:84%
What the...

01:52:44.182 --> 01:52:53.191 align:middle line:84%
I got you, Hobbs.

01:52:53.191 --> 01:53:00.448 align:middle line:84%
Hey!

01:53:00.448 --> 01:53:06.621 align:middle line:90%
- The rotor!
- Losing power.

01:53:06.621 --> 01:54:00.800 align:middle line:90%
- Guys!
- Hattie! Jump!

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.511 align:middle line:84%
Hey, get up. Get up!

01:54:03.511 --> 01:54:05.388 align:middle line:84%
Hey! Get up!

01:54:05.388 --> 01:54:07.724 align:middle line:84%
You don't die until I tell you to die.

01:54:07.724 --> 01:54:09.309 align:middle line:84%
You see the extraction timer?

01:54:09.309 --> 01:54:11.186 align:middle line:84%
When it hits zero,

01:54:11.186 --> 01:54:23.948 align:middle line:90%
empty this clip into her heart,
do you understand?

01:54:23.948 --> 01:54:28.745 align:middle line:84%
Hattie!

01:54:28.745 --> 01:54:31.039 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't end your way, boys.

01:54:31.039 --> 01:54:33.124 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

01:54:33.124 --> 01:54:36.294 align:middle line:84%
Ah, the numbers don't add up for you.

01:54:36.294 --> 01:54:38.171 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of man is coming,

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:42.592 align:middle line:84%
whether you like it or not.

01:54:42.592 --> 01:54:44.719 align:middle line:84%
You know, I almost feel bad for you.

01:54:44.719 --> 01:54:47.138 align:middle line:90%
'Cause it's not just metal
they filled your head with.

01:54:47.138 --> 01:54:51.017 align:middle line:84%
It's bullshit.

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:54.938 align:middle line:90%
I was beginning to like you two,
you know that?

01:54:54.938 --> 01:55:31.891 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well.

01:55:31.891 --> 01:55:35.228 align:middle line:84%
What's the problem, boys? Does it hurt?

01:55:35.228 --> 01:56:09.596 align:middle line:84%
Must be hard being so... human.

01:56:09.596 --> 01:56:10.889 align:middle line:90%
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:56:10.889 --> 01:56:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We work together, we can hurt him.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.184 align:middle line:84%
You're right.

01:56:14.184 --> 01:56:15.268 align:middle line:84%
Time to work as a team.

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:16.853 align:middle line:84%
There's two of us and one of him.

01:56:16.853 --> 01:56:18.855 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a punch and let you land one.

01:56:18.855 --> 01:56:21.274 align:middle line:84%
I'll do the same.

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:22.483 align:middle line:84%
I got your back, brother.

01:56:22.483 --> 01:56:24.569 align:middle line:84%
And I got yours.

01:56:24.569 --> 01:58:18.766 align:middle line:84%
Let's go unplug this sumbitch.

01:58:18.766 --> 01:58:36.075 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the kryptonite.

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:37.702 align:middle line:84%
I got it.

01:58:37.702 --> 01:58:39.287 align:middle line:84%
You did it, Hat.

01:58:39.287 --> 01:58:42.165 align:middle line:84%
Never had a doubt.

01:58:42.165 --> 01:58:49.964 align:middle line:84%
Let's get it into safe hands.

01:58:49.964 --> 01:58:53.301 align:middle line:84%
You set me up as a traitor.

01:58:53.301 --> 01:58:56.721 align:middle line:84%
Turned my own sister against me.

01:58:56.721 --> 01:59:00.725 align:middle line:84%
Forced me to kill my own brother. You.

01:59:00.725 --> 01:59:04.771 align:middle line:84%
And here we are again. Come on!

01:59:04.771 --> 01:59:10.193 align:middle line:84%
Shaw, compared to the cause...

01:59:10.193 --> 01:59:12.654 align:middle line:84%
one life doesn't mean anything.

01:59:12.654 --> 01:59:17.742 align:middle line:90%
I don't know
what happened to you, Brixton.

01:59:17.742 --> 01:59:21.788 align:middle line:84%
But you made me kill you once.

01:59:21.788 --> 01:59:28.545 align:middle line:84%
I ain't doing it again.

01:59:28.545 --> 01:59:32.257 align:middle line:84%
Brother, you may believe in machines...

01:59:32.257 --> 01:59:41.975 align:middle line:84%
but we believe in people.

01:59:41.975 --> 01:59:48.356 align:middle line:90%
You may have all
the technology in the world.

01:59:48.356 --> 01:59:51.442 align:middle line:84%
We have heart.

01:59:51.442 --> 01:59:56.447 align:middle line:84%
No machine will ever beat that.

01:59:56.447 --> 02:00:09.502 align:middle line:90%
You boys, you're gonna get
one Samoan ass-whupping.

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:20.263 align:middle line:84%
Shut Brixton down.

02:00:20.263 --> 02:00:25.768 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it is?

02:00:25.768 --> 02:00:45.872 align:middle line:84%
It's a hell of business, boys.

02:00:45.872 --> 02:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Brixton never really

02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:50.043 align:middle line:84%
lived up to our expectations.

02:00:50.043 --> 02:00:55.131 align:middle line:90%
But you three,
you outperformed your analytics.

02:00:55.131 --> 02:00:59.052 align:middle line:84%
You don't remember me, do you, Hobbs?

02:00:59.052 --> 02:01:01.095 align:middle line:84%
You will.

02:01:01.095 --> 02:01:05.099 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna be a hell of reunion.

02:01:05.099 --> 02:01:08.228 align:middle line:84%
You're on our radar now.

02:01:08.228 --> 02:01:18.655 align:middle line:84%
And you're on ours.

02:01:18.655 --> 02:01:20.114 align:middle line:84%
Hey, thanks for being my sidekick

02:01:20.114 --> 02:01:21.366 align:middle line:84%
through this whole thing, brother.

02:01:21.366 --> 02:01:22.659 align:middle line:84%
You were great.

02:01:22.659 --> 02:01:23.743 align:middle line:84%
Hey, how 'bout I side-kick

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:24.911 align:middle line:84%
that stupid look off your face?

02:01:24.911 --> 02:01:26.538 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? How 'bout you show me right now?

02:01:26.538 --> 02:01:28.456 align:middle line:84%
Okay, guys.

02:01:28.456 --> 02:01:32.627 align:middle line:84%
Let's go home.

02:01:32.627 --> 02:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.
- All right.

02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:37.048 align:middle line:84%
Look, Batman had Robin.

02:01:37.048 --> 02:01:38.967 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Evil had Mini-Me. You're my Mini-Me.

02:01:38.967 --> 02:01:41.636 align:middle line:90%
Han Solo had Chewbacca.
Kermit had Miss Piggy.

02:01:41.636 --> 02:01:43.054 align:middle line:84%
That's a low blow. Don't say that.

02:01:43.054 --> 02:01:44.138 align:middle line:84%
Don't argue with me on my island.

02:01:44.138 --> 02:02:45.408 align:middle line:84%
You're my sidekick.

02:02:45.408 --> 02:02:49.787 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy you're back.

02:02:49.787 --> 02:02:53.208 align:middle line:84%
Brought you that cake you wanted.

02:02:53.208 --> 02:02:57.712 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't eat it.

02:02:57.712 --> 02:03:06.429 align:middle line:84%
Let's get out of here.

02:03:06.429 --> 02:03:10.725 align:middle line:84%
How long have you been working here?

02:03:10.725 --> 02:03:22.695 align:middle line:84%
Sam, this is your grandma.

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:27.742 align:middle line:84%
I love you.

02:03:27.742 --> 02:03:30.119 align:middle line:84%
Good to have you home, uso.

02:03:30.119 --> 02:04:00.608 align:middle line:84%
It's good to be home, uso.

02:04:00.608 --> 02:04:02.443 align:middle line:90%
Hobbs.
I hope you're sitting down, buddy,

02:04:02.443 --> 02:04:03.736 align:middle line:84%
because we got big problems.

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:06.322 align:middle line:90%
God. I feel immediately better
just talking to you.

02:04:06.322 --> 02:04:07.574 align:middle line:84%
Is that weird?

02:04:07.574 --> 02:04:10.535 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, look.
The Snowflake virus, totally fine.

02:04:10.535 --> 02:04:12.537 align:middle line:84%
On lockdown. In a secure asset vault.

02:04:12.537 --> 02:04:17.709 align:middle line:90%
But what we're dealing with right now...
is another virus.

02:04:17.709 --> 02:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
The last one, well,
that melted your insides,

02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:21.921 align:middle line:84%
but this one...

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:24.632 align:middle line:84%
melts your outsides. Literally.

02:04:24.632 --> 02:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Your skin drips off.

02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
It's like removing
a silk kimono in a hurricane.

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.804 align:middle line:84%
It's so gross.

02:04:29.804 --> 02:04:33.224 align:middle line:90%
The point is we need to
get on this, like, now.

02:04:33.224 --> 02:04:35.143 align:middle line:84%
I need both of you.

02:04:35.143 --> 02:04:36.227 align:middle line:84%
What do you say, Becky?

02:04:36.227 --> 02:04:38.479 align:middle line:90%
- Hey, Locke. This is Sam.
- Sam?

02:04:38.479 --> 02:04:39.606 align:middle line:84%
You must wanna talk to my dad.

02:04:39.606 --> 02:04:42.025 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my God. Sam.

02:04:42.025 --> 02:04:47.113 align:middle line:84%
Wow! You sound exactly like your dad.

02:04:47.113 --> 02:04:49.365 align:middle line:84%
It's freaking me out right now.

02:04:49.365 --> 02:04:51.701 align:middle line:84%
It's like listening to a mirror.

02:04:51.701 --> 02:04:53.786 align:middle line:90%
- Can you put Hobbs on?
- I'm on.

02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:56.039 align:middle line:90%
I know, but I need
to speak to Hobbs, sweetie.

02:04:56.039 --> 02:04:57.874 align:middle line:84%
I'm on. What do you want?

02:04:57.874 --> 02:04:59.334 align:middle line:84%
I mean, seriously,

02:04:59.334 --> 02:05:00.919 align:middle line:84%
record yourself side by... It's crazy.

02:05:00.919 --> 02:05:02.587 align:middle line:84%
Listen, before you say another word,

02:05:02.587 --> 02:05:03.963 align:middle line:84%
tell me you took care of the Snowflake.

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:06.299 align:middle line:84%
I got it. It's done. We're good, okay?

02:05:06.299 --> 02:05:08.092 align:middle line:90%
'Cause I care about people.
I care about our family.

02:05:08.092 --> 02:05:09.177 align:middle line:90%
- You are not family.
- I know.

02:05:09.177 --> 02:05:10.595 align:middle line:84%
What we have is so much deeper.

02:05:10.595 --> 02:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Listen, hey, real talk...

02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.682 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that
Game of Thrones ending?

02:05:14.682 --> 02:05:15.767 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it.

02:05:15.767 --> 02:05:19.354 align:middle line:90%
You watched the shit out of it,
you dirty little liar.

02:05:19.354 --> 02:05:21.147 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?
You said there was a problem.

02:05:21.147 --> 02:05:23.566 align:middle line:84%
My problem is that Jon Snow

02:05:23.566 --> 02:05:25.777 align:middle line:84%
had sex with his aunt, then killed her,

02:05:25.777 --> 02:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and nobody wants to talk about it.

02:05:27.070 --> 02:05:29.989 align:middle line:84%
That's what my problem is.

02:05:29.989 --> 02:07:14.073 align:middle line:84%
Jesus. Hang on a second here.

02:07:14.073 --> 02:07:15.533 align:middle line:84%
Let me guess.

02:07:15.533 --> 02:07:17.327 align:middle line:84%
You have a mission to save the world.

02:07:17.327 --> 02:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
You just can't do it without me.

02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:20.789 align:middle line:84%
No, man.

02:07:20.789 --> 02:07:22.415 align:middle line:84%
I was just checking in on you.

02:07:22.415 --> 02:07:25.084 align:middle line:84%
Seeing how my good friend is doing.

02:07:25.084 --> 02:07:27.295 align:middle line:84%
And I, um...

02:07:27.295 --> 02:07:29.214 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to hear this.

02:07:29.214 --> 02:07:30.423 align:middle line:84%
Police!

02:07:30.423 --> 02:07:32.467 align:middle line:84%
Come out with your hands up!

02:07:32.467 --> 02:07:36.471 align:middle line:84%
We know you're in there, Hugh Janus.

02:07:36.471 --> 02:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
You bastard.

02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:41.601 align:middle line:84%
I warned you, you bald-headed sumbitch.

02:07:41.601 --> 02:07:44.854 align:middle line:84%
When you least expect it... expect it.

02:07:44.854 --> 02:07:46.815 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea what you've just started.

02:07:46.815 --> 02:07:47.899 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm pretty sure it involves

02:07:47.899 --> 02:07:50.235 align:middle line:84%
rubber gloves and a body cavity search.

02:07:50.235 --> 02:07:55.281 align:middle line:84%
Not a chance.

02:07:55.281 --> 02:07:56.366 align:middle line:84%
Police!

02:07:56.366 --> 02:07:58.159 align:middle line:84%
Get on the ground, Hugh Janus!

02:07:58.159 --> 02:08:02.497 align:middle line:90%
This ain't gonna go down
how you boys expect.

02:08:02.497 --> 02:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll be seeing you, Hobbs.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.382 align:middle line:84%
Looking forward to it, Shaw.

02:08:09.382 --> 02:15:55.083 align:middle line:90%

02:15:55.083 --> 02:15:56.459 align:middle line:84%
Are you okay?

02:15:56.459 --> 02:15:59.545 align:middle line:84%
Okay.

02:15:59.545 --> 02:16:01.923 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely wounded now, so...

02:16:01.923 --> 02:16:04.008 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna really need
that extraction, Big Papa.

02:16:04.008 --> 02:16:06.094 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what, sit tight.
I'm coming to get you.

02:16:06.094 --> 02:16:07.261 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you didn't mind,

02:16:07.261 --> 02:16:08.846 align:middle line:90%
you could bring a couple
of pints of blood as well.

02:16:08.846 --> 02:16:09.931 align:middle line:84%
Locke...

02:16:09.931 --> 02:16:11.224 align:middle line:84%
Don't you wanna know my blood type?

02:16:11.224 --> 02:16:12.934 align:middle line:84%
What's your blood type?

02:16:12.934 --> 02:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's B+. Just like my life outlook.

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:18.982 align:middle line:90%
- Imagine that.
- Locke.

02:16:18.982 --> 02:16:20.733 align:middle line:90%
- Locke?
- Jesus, I'm bleeding a lot.

02:16:20.733 --> 02:16:23.486 align:middle line:90%
God. I'm bleeding so, so much
right now.

02:16:23.486 --> 02:16:24.988 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no. Actually, wait, hold on a second.

02:16:24.988 --> 02:16:26.531 align:middle line:84%
That's not my blood.

02:16:26.531 --> 02:16:28.366 align:middle line:84%
That's not my blood.

02:16:28.366 --> 02:16:30.076 align:middle line:84%
Oh, God, I thought that was me!

02:16:30.076 --> 02:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
By the way,

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:34.497 align:middle line:84%
I stabbed a guy with a brick.

02:16:34.497 --> 02:16:35.915 align:middle line:84%
How crazy is that?

02:16:35.915 --> 02:16:38.305 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, it's not that hard.

02:16:38.305 --> 02:16:43.305 align:middle line:84%
